# EarlySaints Database
The scholars who form the [EarlySaints Research Group](http://earlysaints.byu.edu/) have a common purpose: documenting the lives of the early followers of Joseph Smith, Jr. and the Church he restored. However, we are doing it in separate projects, with different technologies, different conceptual frameworks, and different levels of availability to the public. 

The purpose of this project is to look for ways to make these disparate databases work together, so that other scholars and the general public can more easily access the latest information on people of interest. We have several possible goals:

- Identifying and storing possible matching persons within and between databases, enabling the traversal between them as Linked Data.
- Creating a Linked Data interface to each database, so each presents a common view to the public and applications.
- Searching across databases and collating the results, so that a single interface could be used to search for a person and see what each database says about him or her.
- Developing or augmenting the ontologies/schemas/vocabularies necessary for these databases to interoperate.

The datasets we are working with are of two types:
- Biographical Databases: collections of a variety of information about each person (name, birth, death, etc.), much like the myriad genealogical databases out there, preferably supported by quality research and primary sources.
- Source Databases: direct transcriptions of source records that generally consist of lists, such as censuses, land records, and church memberships.
