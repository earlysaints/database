# GEDCOM to JSON-LD

In email conversations 2015-04-17, we discussed using JSON-LD as our shared data format.
Since I have a working knowlege of GEDCOM 5.5, and since Maurine Ward and Ron Watt's work is in GEDCOM format,
I decided to begin writing a GEDCOM to JSON-LD converter.
In doing so, I ran into a few problems, documented here.

## GEDCOM Identifiers are Blank Nodes

In GEDCOM, indentifers are scoped to an individual file and may change every single time the file is saved.
This makes them very similar to JSON-LD's blank nodes; I convert `@I123` into `_:I123`.

For creating a match databases, we'll need durable identifiers too.
Legacy Family Tree, the tool used by Ward and Watt, has durable unique identifiers in their `_UID` fields.
I do not know how widespread this practice is.

*Brandon: if the identifiers in GEDCOM are anything like the RIN in PAF, they tend to be durable (but yes, are only scoped within the file). However, that is probably up to the whim of whatever software created the file. I do not know what standard the Legacy UID comes from, but it is probably not a common practice among genealogy software. The EarlyLDS database only uses the GEDCOM I... identifiers.*

## Content and Nested Nodes

In GEDCOM, each element may have *both* some content (either text or a link)
*and* nested elements (or just one of the two, or neither).
In JSON-LD, a node may have one or the other but not both:
If a node has `@value`, it cannot also have non-`@` members.

We'll take as an example in this section the following GEDCOM snippet:

```
0 @I1@ INDI
1 NAME Stephen Joseph /Abbott/
2 GIVN Stephen Joseph
2 SURN Abbott
```

Some possible solutions:

### Double-depth

If a node has children and content, we insert a holder object to store them.

```
{ "@id": "_:I1"
, "@type": "INDI"
, "NAME":
  { "value": "Stephen Joseph /Abbott/"
  , "nested":
    { "GIVN": "Stephen Joseph"
    , "SURN": "Abbot"
    }
  }
}
```

### Payload field

We could use something like 
`http://schema.org/Property`, 
`http://schema.org/Text`,
`http://schema.org/URL`,
`http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label`,
or another IRI of our own design to represent the payload.
Rather than pick one, I'll assume the `@context` defines aliases `$text` and `$link`.

```
{ "@id": "_:I1"
, "@type": "INDI"
, "NAME":
  { "$text": "Stephen Joseph /Abbott/"
  , "GIVN": "Stephen Joseph"
  , "SURN": "Abbot"
  }
}
```

I explored other options but found them both more verbose and less clear.

I'll use the payload field approach in my examples below.

> (Brandon): This situation will come up quite often when we have a value with qualifiers, so we need to make sure we have a good generic solution; this requirement to associate a single content with a key is an inherent characteristic of all key-value/triple formats, including JSON and RDF, right? Your payload approach is almost identical to the most common way of handling this in RDF with a blank node. I don't like the fact that I have to take two hops to get to the value (which I have to do either way). The approach I've been working on, based on the quad/named graph idea in RDF (but not following it exactly), is to give every statement an identifier, so the qualifiers are pointing to the original statement by reference, not by nesting. For example, in pseudocode:*
> 
> ```
> 25: @I1@ NAME "Stephen Joseph /Abbott/"
> 26: 25 GIVN "Stephen Joseph"
> 27: 25 SURN "Abbott"
> ```
> 
> I have found it to be a clean way of handling a lot of complex situations. However, doing this in JSON-LD would be very unwieldy (every statement is an independent object), and would break the nested object model that makes JSON-LD nice to use.*

> (Luther): I agree on all points, Brandon:
> this case will arise repeatedly so we'll need a standard solution,
> and solutions for other data models are not very JSON-LD-like.

One reason JSON-LD has *not* chosen to implement value-and-nested syntax
is that it makes the common JSON access syntax ambiguous; does `person.NAME` (or `person["NAME"]`) yield the string (`"Stephen Joseph /Abbott/"`) or the object (with keys `GIVN` and `SURN`)?
There is no obvious clean and elegant work-around.

> (Luther) Well, none in dynamically-typed languages anyway.
> In statically-typed languages with tagged union (as opposed to polymorphism-based) JSON libraries
> it is straightforward to have the typed-value access syntax overloaded for `$text`, `$link`, `@value`, full-object, and raw-value fields.
> In languages with return-type overloading (Haskell and Perl) we could do even betterâ€¦

> (Brandon) This returning of value and/or qualifiers is actually an issue with my quads approach; because the GIVN connection is a back reference, the complete NAME object doesn't exist as such in the database. It has to be built by gathering all the statements that are about an item (and all the statements that are about those statements, and so on up the tree). This is not terribly difficult (a little more so in SQL of course), but it is an additional step.

## `CONT` and `CONC` tags

GEDCOM has two nested tags, `CONT` and `CONC`, that are present only to allow text
to span multiple lines of the .ged file.
I am assuming these will be removed as a pre-processing step and not show up in the JSON-LD.

```
2 SOUR @S50@
3 PAGE M432, roll M432_919, p. 158, image 325, dwelling 155, famil
4 CONC y 155, Abigail Abbott household
3 QUAY 3
```

becomes

```
  , "SOUR" :
    { "$link": "_:S50"
    , "PAGE": "M432, roll M432_919, p. 158, image 325, dwelling 155, family 155, Abigail Abbott household"
    , "QUAY": 3
    }
```

## Normalization

I am not sure if we want to normalize data.
Some things we might want to normalize at some point:

* Are there family entities (as in GEDCOM) or links directly between parent/child?
* Do we standardize dates, names, places, etc., in some way?
* Do we allow free-form fields but have very descriptive `@type`s like `daterange#gregorian#start(YYYY)-end(YYYY-MM-DD)`?

I perform no normalization in the examples in this document.

*Brandon: As we discussed earlier, I think we start with minimal normalization (for the matching phase at least): let each database model the data the way it wants. The downside of that is that we have to be aware of 3-4 ways of representing a family, 3-4 ways of representing birth/death/etc. events, 3-4 ways of representing dates, and so on. The alternative is that we have to decide a "correct" model to transform everything into, and frankly, after a long time of working on this, I'm not sure what that is. As for dates and places, I propose we don't normalize initially, but allow ourselves to do it later. We could either use different properties (placeText, placeURI, placeWKT, placeClean, etc.) or different types ("place": . . . @type: URI, etc.). Both have advantages and disadvantages. The latter seems cleaner, but will have your multimap problem below, because a single property may have several "values" (same value in different formats). For standardized dates, I actually like the date format in GEDCOMX; it even handles uncertainty in a reasonable (if not 100% complete) way.*

> (Luther) @Brandon: Agreed.  We'll want to cross this bridge eventually, I suspect, but for the purpose of initial match generation I don't think it will be necessary.
> 
> The multimap idea is actually has precedent in JSON-LD; see, for example, [the `"@container" : "@language"` example usage in the current JSON-LD standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#string-internationalization).
> Defining appropriate `@container`-like syntax will probably be something we tackle at some point.


## Multimaps

GEDCOM (and JSON, but not JSON-LD) has a multimap model; 
for example,

```
0 @F595@ FAM
1 HUSB @I2907@
1 WIFE @I2908@
1 MARR
1 CHIL @I671@
1 CHIL @I2909@
1 CHIL @I2944@
1 CHIL @I675@
```

has multiple `CHIL` fields.

I convert `MultiMap<K,V>` into `Map<K,Set<V>>`, as follows:

```
{ "@id": "_:F595"
, "@type": "FAM"
, "HUSB": "_:I2907"
, "WIFE": "_:I2908"
, "MARR": null
, "CHIL":
  [ "_:I671"
  , "_:I2909"
  , "_:I2944"
  , "_:I675"
  ]
}
```

## Larger Example

```
0 @I675@ INDI
1 NAME Phineas Howe /Young/
2 GIVN Phineas Howe
2 SURN Young
2 SOUR @S3@
1 SEX M
1 _UID E986FD790B444E2A8DDBF4B921A89B2449EB
1 CHAN
2 DATE 12 Mar 2010
3 TIME 21:28
1 FAMS @F594@
1 FAMC @F595@
0 @F595@ FAM
1 HUSB @I2907@
1 WIFE @I2908@
1 MARR
1 CHIL @I671@
1 CHIL @I2909@
1 CHIL @I2944@
1 CHIL @I675@
1 CHAN
2 DATE 12 Mar 2010
3 TIME 21:28
```

```
[ { "@id": "_:I675"
  , "@type": "INDI"
  , "NAME":
    { "$text": "Phineas Howe /Young/"
    , "GIVN": "Phineas Howe"
    , "SURN": Young"
    , "SOUR": "_:S3"
    }
  , "SEX": "M"
  , "_UID": "E986FD790B444E2A8DDBF4B921A89B2449EB"
  , "CHAN":
    { "DATE":
      { "$text": "12 Mar 2010"
      , "TIME": "21:28"
      }
    }
  , "FAMS": "_:F594"
  , "FAMC": "_:F595"
  }
, { "@id": "_:F595"
  , "@type": "FAM"
  , "HUSB": "_:I2907"
  , "WIFE": "_:I2908"
  , "MARR": null
  , "CHIL":
    [ "_:I671"
    , "_:I2909"
    , "_:I2944"
    , "_:I675"
    ]
  , "CHAN":
    { "DATE":
      { "$text": "12 Mar 2010"
      , "TIME": "21:28"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

*Brandon: I think this is a reasonable way to handle a many-to-many link. I think my quad approach above is better theoretically, but not in JSON-LD. One question; if I am trying to find this link from the child's perspective ("which families is _:I671 in?"), how difficult will it be? I know it is a bit cumbersome when storing FK arrays in a ORDBMS.*

> (Luther) @Brandon: GEDCOM puts the link in both; you'll see that _:I675 has fields "FAMS" and "FAMC" which point to all the "FAM"-type nodes in which _:I675 participates.
> If we stored it in only one place, we'd want a graph database engine rather than a relational database engine in order to answer those queries efficiently.

## Context

To do: create a GEDCOM-appropriate `@context` object.

*Brandon: I get the feeling that it is best practice in JSON-LD to create a separate context for each incoming model that translates into universal URI's, right?*

> (Luther) @Brandon: that is my understanding too.
