1,histories,1165963853,,,,"Biographical Sketch of Samuel Harrison Smith",,,,,,0,,0,,0,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"	[page 1] Salt Lake City, June 24, 1914.  By his [Samuel H. Smith's] daughter, Mrs. B. S. [Mary Bailey Smith] Norman.

	My father [Samuel Harrison Smith], at the time of his brothers' arrest and imprisonment in Carthage Jail, determined to go to them at once, well knowing that their lives were in danger.  He set out for Carthage, taking with him a 14 year old boy who was working for him.  They traveled by team and wagon, and when they neared Carthage, were met by a guard of the mob who, apprehending his coming, had been placed there to intercept him.  They allowed the boy to proceed with the team, but he was turned back.  He gave the boy instructions to go direct to the Hamilton House in Carthage and there await further orders.  He then returned home as quickly as possible, purchased a horse noted for its speed, and determined to reach his brothers in time to be of assistance to them, although the hope seemed a forlorn one.  He went unarmed, and as he again neared Carthage, he met several people coming from there in great haste, among them a man and a woman in a buggy of whom he asked what had happened and received answer that ""the two Smiths had been killed by the mob.""

	The terrible shock was too much for him and for an instant he reeled in his saddle and they expected him to fall.  Then, as the necessity of immediate action flashed across his mind, he steadied himself saying, ""God help me!  I must go to them,"" and he again pressed forward.  The mob, expecting his return and intent upon murder, were secreted in a thicket and two men on horseback with rifles gave chase.  As they emerged from the thicket, the man in the buggy gave a warning shout.  My father, turning his head quickly, took in the situation at a glance and put his horse to its utmost speed, still keeping his course straight toward Carthage.  His splendid horsemanship kept him somewhat out of the range of the bullets sent after him; the one passed through the top of his hat.  The chase was a long and exciting one, but he finally out distanced them and rode into Carthage and made his way to the jail, being the first to arrive there after the tragedy.  The mob, in the meantime, had dispersed.

	Mr. Hamilton of the Hamilton Hotel met my father [Samuel Harrison Smith] and gave him all the assistance that lay in his power in caring for the bodies of his murdered brothers.  The [page 2] next day, in company with Willard Richards and others, my father accompanied the bodies to Nauvoo and to the Nauvoo Mansion where they lay in state in the large dining hall while thousands of the mourning multitude passed through to get a last look at their beloved prophet and his devoted brother.

	I have given reminiscences of those trying times, but what I am now writing is confined to incidents concerning my father.

	My father [Samuel Harrison Smith], after the funeral of his brothers, moved to Nauvoo and took up his residence in a two story frame house opposite the Mansion House.  Soon there was a strange quiet pervading the house.  My sister, my brother, and myself were banished to the room above with the injunction to keep quiet; our father was very sick.  We no longer had our romps as often in times past  we would make the circuit of the room in a wild chase to see which could clamber first to his knee to get the first kiss, often all on his knee at once, then clamber down again and renew the chase; then when my little brother, Samuel, who was the youngest, would become tired, we would have to give way to him, and my father would take him on his knee and sing him to sleep.  To our great wonderment, all this had become a thing of the past.

	Finally, for a day or two, we only went down to our meals.  The tread in the sick room became more soft, the whispers more low, then a silence save for sobs  our kind and noble father had passed to the great beyond to meet his martyred brothers and all the dear ones gone before him, and we three were left orphans, for our mother had died a victim of the Missouri persecutions.  Our father had married again, and by this last marriage had one surviving child, then a beautiful little tot of a girl just beginning to walk.  My stepmother (a mild, quiet little body) at the time of my father's death, was again soon to become a mother, and with three stepchildren, one child of her own, and another soon to claim her care, she was indeed in a helpless condition.

	I shall now give an account of what happened to my sister, Susan, my brother, Samuel, and myself after our father's death.  My stepmother, a short time afterwards, went to see her parents who lived some distance from where we did.  She gave us privilege to play on the river bank, but admonished us to not venture into the water.  She told us she would be back as quickly as possible, then taking her little one [page 3] (our half sister, Levira), she left us.  As near as I can remember, it was well into the afternoon when she went.  We were happy in the thought of long play hours.  We soon made our way to the river and amused ourselves playing in the sand and with the pretty carnelians which at that time were very abundant at that point on the shores of the Mississippi.  We played until the sinking sun warned us that we had better return home.  When we reached the house, we found the doors locked.  We sat down on the doorsteps to await her coming.  Our stepmother had been taken dangerously ill.  We sat on the steps and went to sleep.

	My grandmother sent for me and cared for me for a few days, but her ills soon prevented her from caring for me.  In the meantime, my Aunt Mary Fielding Smith, my Uncle Hyrum's widow (Joseph F.  Smith's mother), had been caring for my brother and sister.  She now took charge of me also; however, every night we would meet and sit on the step of the house that had once been our home until our Aunt Mary would send for us and have us taken to her home.  But there came a time that, for some reason, we expected our stepmother home that night, and when the man of all works came for us, we objected to going and cried bitterly.  A boy had come with him to assist in carrying us.  He sent the boy back to state the condition of affairs.  The boy soon returned with a message to ""not grieve us by trying to bring us against our will, but to wait until we were asleep and then bring us.""  Left to ourselves, we cuddled together and were soon fast asleep.  The next I remember I was awakened to eat my supper.  This act of kindness, so delicate, so tender, so beautiful, has during a long life so often been present to my mind, and I am unable to express in words the gratitude I have always felt.

	Aunt Mary Fielding Smith was the second wife of my father's brother, Hyrum Smith, and the mother of President Joseph F. Smith.  I will give a pen picture of her as I remember her.  She had a fine personality, was at that time tall and rather slender, fair in complexion, and a perfect type of the English gentlewoman.

	To complete my story  Aunt Mary took care of us until we were otherwise provided for.  My father, Samuel H. Smith, was a man of most sterling qualities.  He never shunned an obligation nor failed in any task it was his duty to perform, manual as well as mental labor.  His great strength far exceeding that of ordinary [page 4] men enabled him to do an unusual amount of work, and he often came to the aid of his father's family in time of need.  Nor did he fail in his efforts in behalf of his brothers in their greatest and last extremity.  His failure to rescue them at Carthage was due to no fault of his own, but to uncontrollable circumstances.

“I, Jane Johnston Black, was born June 11, 1801, at Lombag, Antrim County, Ireland, the daughter of Daniel Johnston and Margaret Chambers. I lived at my father's house until I was sixteen years of age when my father died. I was then called as a local preacher on the same circuit that my father had traveled, he being a Wesleyan Methodist. I remained in that position until I was over twenty years] of age, and made William Black Sr's house my home, as he was my guardian.

I lived there until my marriage to his son, William, who had been away serving as a soldier in the British Army. 

We were married July 31, 1822, and lived in Lisburn, Antrim County, Ireland. We had three sons and one daughter.

Moved to Manchester, England, in the year 1834 or 1835, with my husband and family. 

We heard of the people called Latter-day Saints and were invited to go and hear them; the meeting was held in Paul Harris' cellar. William Clayton and Joseph Fielding addressed us, which brought glad tidings and great joy to my husband and myself. We both believed, and on or about the 14th day of January, 1839, were baptized by Elder William Clayton. 

Then in the year of 1840, we (mother and children) moved to Nauvoo and heard the Prophet Joseph Smith preach and I can testify that he was a prophet of God. 

We came to Nauvoo under the Council of the Authorities and left my husband on a two-year mission. 

We moved to Augusta [Iowa] and remained there until my husband came home. 

I, being a doctor and also a nurse, President [Smith and or]Young set me apart to deliver all expecting mothers and care for the sick and I fully did my duty.

[In 1844] Following the martyrdom at Carthage, President Taylor, who had been seriously wounded, would not permit a doctor to see him until Jane Black arrived after the bullets were removed from his body. Mrs. Black asked him later why he had sent for her. He said, ""Because I knew there was none better at such a job, and wanted you to stand at the morning of the resurrection and testify to the Lord against the assassins who murdered the Prophet and his brother Hyrum."" [See Note 1 below.]

We then moved to Nauvoo again and remained there until the Saints were driven from there. My husband being in Canada at the time.

I went with the Saints to Montrose[Iowa across the Mississippi from Nauvoo].   

Before crossing the Mississippi River. A posse of the mob rode up and surrounded our wagons and demanded we give up our fire arms. I had a pistol in my bosom and I drew it out and told them 'Here is my pistol, but I will use it before I give it up.' They did not take it from me but threatened to throw me in the river that night.

Then we were ferried across the Mississippi River into Iowa and remained there a short time. I buried what arms I had in a quilt in a hole under the wagon wheel. 

I borrowed a tent from Brother Johnston and had women that were being delivered at childbirth put in it. . I was the mid-wife, and delivered nine babies that night. [See Note 2.]

We had nothing to eat but a half bushel of corn meal and a half-dozen cucumbers that were given to me by Martin Littlewood. 

There were a great many sick among us and nothing to comfort and nourish them but corn meal, until the Lord sent quails among us which supplied our wants. Blessed be the name of the Lord.

""We had nothing to sweeten anything with until the Lord sent honey dew, which we gathered from the bushes until we had all the sweets we wanted. I also boiled maple juice and got cakes of maple sugar. 

While preparing to leave Montrose, I was engaged in taking up the firearms I had buried under the wagon, when the mob came and asked me what I was doing. I told them the Saints were to have power to resurrect and that was what I was doing. 'Oh,' said one, 'she is crazy,' so I saved our arms. 

We then moved about eight miles up the river and pitched our tents and there my husband joined us. Then the Saints moved into Winters Quarters. 

[About a year later we settled in Silver Creek Branch, Pottawattamie, Iowa] where we stayed about a year. 

We started across the plains by ox teams in Captain Pace's company. ""After a weary trialsome journey over 1,000 miles walking fifteen to twenty miles a day on foot to ease the load on the team, we arrived in Salt Lake Valley in 1850. 

We lived there for a short time, then President Brigham Young called us to go to Spring City, Sanpete County. We remained there until 1861. 

Then we were called to go to St. George. Later we moved up the Virgin River to a place called Rockville, Washington County. I lived there until my husband died and was laid to rest in the Rockville Cemetery, Washington County. I lived there for many years after all my children had moved away.

I felt very lonely and they wanted me to move where they lived in Deseret in Millard County, Utah. Finally I decided to go to my children so I moved to Deseret.""  

I continued to live there until the year 1878, when feeling lonesome for my children who lived in Deseret, I was persuaded to leave my home and come and live with them, where I have lived until the present date.

Feeling my health declining and being sick at the present time, my sons have been desirous that I should leave a short history of my life. But my memory has failed me in many things, so that I have not been able to give a complete account or as much as I should like to do, being in my eighty-seventh year.

NOTE 1

Note regarding Jane Johnston Black, Physician and midwife Jane was one of the best known pioneer women in the different localities in which she lived. She gained recognition for her medical services, not only in the various settlements in southern Utah, but during the period which preceded the exodus of the Saints from Nauvoo. According to family records she was called and blessed by the Prophet Joseph Smith, setting her apart to give aid to those who were ill. It is known that she gave active support to the defenders of Nauvoo during the mobbings and administered aid to the men who were injured. She was frequently the only woman on the scene of battle.

As an obstetrician Jane took a leading part in giving medical assistance when nine babies were born in the midst of winter as the Saints were being forced to leave Nauvoo under mob attack.

Her records show that she delivered more than 3,000 babies. Not only was she known as a midwife, but took the place of a physician whenever needed. On one occasion she was called upon to amputate a man's leg in order to save his life. She used an ordinary butcher knife and a carpenter's saw to perform the operation. The man recovered.

After a long and eventful life, Jane Johnston Black died at the age of 92 years and was buried in Rockville, Utah.

Note 2.

Note verifying that Jane Johnston Black was the midwife who delivered nine babies the night of the exodus from Nauvoo. Carol Lynn Pearson, well-known LDS poetess, wrote an article in BYU Studies about the episode and tells of finding a statement of a midwife, Jane Johnston, who personally delivered nine babies on the first night in September when the so-called ""poor camp"" was camping across from Nauvoo.  Conditions during this exodus were much different than the one seven months earlier. The Saints who had remained in Nauvoo during 1846 were mostly those who could not afford to outfit themselves for the exodus (hence the name ""poor camp""), or those whose health or other conditions prevented them from traveling. But when the mobs came to Nauvoo in September 1846, they cruelly drove all the Saints from their homes regardless of condition. The account of Jane Johnston, describing conditions across the Mississippi from Nauvoo, reads: “I borrowed a tent from Brother Johnston and had women that were being delivered at childbirth put in it. I was the mid-wife, and delivered nine babies that night.”

It seems much more likely that the events Eliza described occurred during this time, and the midwife's account supports this idea. Eliza mentions that she ""was informed"" that the nine births occurred on that first night, but she (or her informant) probably confused the date.

However, the poignancy and tenderness of Eliza Snow's description still touches the heart. The suffering of these mothers is beyond our conception, and is a tribute both to their faith in God and to their patient commitment to what they viewed to be a divine cause.

The sheriff and the county turned out and dispursed the marauders from the county but by their continued depredations, we agreed to leave in the spring of 1846 for the west for California or some point. In the Fall of 1845 we went into arrangements for removal. I hardly knew whether I should have means to start. After much, much struggle and fatigue, by the assistance of Miss Bradford, a widow, I made out to start in may the 15, 1846.

I went one mile to the river, stayed on the bank of the river over night, crossed over in the morning, went one mile to the bluff. Stayed over night, was met the next morning by my brother-in-law, Simeon Howd who lived on the river Des Moin, eight miles from our camp. I started in company with him to go to his house. Went three miles through a very bad road put up for night. Started in the morning, got to his house near sundown stayed there two weeks in which time my wife, Caroline, was confined and brought forth a fine son.

Started from there the first of June in company with Simeon Howd and Miss Bradford and her father and mother and her brother and wife who was sick with the consumption. We traveled three days with considerable difficulty in consequence of bad roads, got to Farmington, crossed the river Des Moins traveled 70 miles through scattered settlements which brought us into an extensive prairie of a hundred and 30 miles where we came to the camp of the saints in the fore part of Pisgal. We stayed there 8 or 10 days. Brother Sprig whose wife was sick with the consumption died. Then we started for Council Bluffs of a 130 miles. We arrived there not far from the 10th of the month of July, when the call was mace by the United States for volunteers for California. Council from the President of our Church was to go. I camped my family on Missouri bottoms one mile from the Mormon ferry in company with John and Nathan Taner here. I enrolled my name in the army for California the 15th of July. On the 18th of July my daughter Sariah was taken sick with a fever which was poor. On the 22nd day of July we took up a line of march for Fort Levensworth. Traveled three miles camped for the night, Having no tents, we made a little shelter of brush to lay under. The night passed off. We took up march in the morning. I started with a heavy heart, looking back on the condition of my family.

We traveled 13 miles. Night overtook again. Took our lodging under the brush again. About midnight Brother Boland of the Third company died, was buried in the morning in his blanket and some books around him. Took up the march. I started again with my wholly upon the condition of my family. This was on the 23rd day of July, a very hot and sultry day. We camped this night 4 miles from Nishnabotna. Here we camped in the woods on a little creek. The night passed off very agreeably.

With the most of the company we took up march this the morning of the 25th, passed through Nishnabotna, crossed the big Tarkio a beautiful stream and a beautiful pleasant country, fine rolling prairie and a good quantity of timber, good crops of grain of all kinds.

Here we come in Atchison County the first county in the boundry. We camped near the county seat for the night. Little before dark Brother Morly came into our camp. Here one of our men was taken sick. Hands was laid on him and he recovered in a day or two. In seeing disease and sickness coming into our camp my feelings were wrought up to consider the uncomfortable situation of my family and the anxiety of my mind was inexpressible. I particularly requested Brother Morly to see my folks or the Brothers Taners and send my wife word concerning me here.

We rose on the morning of the 26th of July with just rations enough for our breakfast. Traveled till noon. Stopped as usual for two hours, had nothing for dinner and the day extremely hot and sultry. Some of the men getting sick. The country is a beautiful rolling prairie with small groves of timber. We took up line of march for the afternoon traveled til night. Our commissary went to hunt for provisions but did not catch up with us so we had little or no supper but ate some meat and drank some coffee and laid down under a few bushes for the night. The commissary came up about midnight.

We rose in the morning took our breakfast. On the morning of the 27 of July ordered to march. The day very sultry and hot, and traveling under the south side of the bluff we traveled on til noon. Stopped as usual for rest when a brother by the name Thayer overtook us from the bluffs which caused me to inquire for my folks and Brother Taner. He told me that Brother Taner and his boys had gone over the river which gave me such sorrow and grief but we had to march as usual. But the news that I heard drove my mind anxiously homeward for it seemed to me that I should sink under every step that I took. I could hardly help from showing my feelings to every person that I spoke to.

Night came on. We camped as usual having a few bushes for our covering. Rose the following morning took up our line of march as usual traveling through a beautiful rolling country with convenient groves of timber. The weather very warm and uncomfortable. Came into a little town by the name Oregon, a beautiful situation. The inhabitants very friendly, apparently. Left there a little before noon. Traveled on til nearly night. Crossed the Nodaway, a beautiful stream of water where we camped for the night. Here we came into a timbered country timber heavy and thick. The weather extremely hot and uncomfortable traveling. We traveled  several days in the timber. Came into quite a large town by the name of St. Joseph. This town is on the Missouri River and is a handsome place. We marched through in double file with the music in front in good nearly all the inhabitants gathered by the sides of the streets, in stores and houses gazing as though they were amazed and observed that we kept the best order and made the best appearance of any company that ever marched through the town.

We traveled on 5 or 6 miles camped for the night on a little creek on the Missouri River bottom. Camped as usual under a few bushes. Here I saw Brother Matthews again returning from Fort Levensworth to Council Bluff. I improved the night and wrote a letter to my family. Rose early in the morning, looked up the brethern gave him the letter with overbalanced anxiety that it should get to my family, not knowing where they were or what had become of them after hearing that the Brothers Taners had gone over the river, which I learned after a number of days was incorrect, which gave me some peace of mind. After breakfast we took up the line of march, traveled on for a number of miles, raising the bluffs again into the timber again onto what was called the Snake Hills, passing a few houses in a place that was called Bloomfield. Camped 6 miles east of place for the night. About 11 or 12 o’clock at night there rose a boisterous wind and blowed the trees and timber in every direction a short distance from us, but there was not a tree nor limb fell to the ground where we were camped. In going along the road the nest morning and seeing the trees and limber in every direction it truly seemed as though the kind hand of the Lord had kept us from the power of the wind.

The next place we came into was Weston 6 miles above Fort Levensworth. We passed through this town on the 31 day of July. The weather intensely hot and dry. The inhabitants of the town gathered upon every side and corner of the street looking with unexpected amazement to see so many Mormons enlisted which they thought would not be done. In this town I saw John__gle standing in the door of a stable who was one of the men _______ the murder of ______ Smith which _____________ June 27, 1844. Marched one mile and below town made halt about two o’clock for the night. Here we were 170 miles from the bluffs, very much fatigued and tired and our clothes all dirty. I tool my clothes and some soap went to the little creek to wash. The water only 3 or 4 inches deep and the bottom very muddy. I rubbed on some soap put my clothes into the water and the mud and dirt stuck to them as fast as I could wash it off. I took it and wrung them out. By this time it was nearly night. We took supper laid down as usual under some bushes.

Rose in the morning. After breakfast took up the line of march, came to the river Buwhare. We crossed over to the fort. It took most part of the day. We all got over, formed the line marched up to the fort in order to the west side of the fort and camped for the night. Made a draft on the quartermaster and drawed our tents. Now every fellow went to work and pitched our tents. 

Now it was night and the first day of August. We rested trough the night very comfortable in our tents for the first and tenth day of our travel. I rose in the morning second of August looked around the fort. Everything looked solitary and lonesome, nothing looked interesting or intelligent. As I had been used to seeing and hearing the scribes that were well instructed bring forth out of his treasures things both new and old it seemed as though the power of darkness controlled the air and elements.

But we possessed to draw out rations, guns, and equipage, knapsacks and canteens in which time I was waiting with the greatest anxiety of mind that a man could have that had a family that was near and dear to him. Least this might fall into the hands of some that might think that I had unnecessary feelings in regard to my family, I would just say that they were left in the open prairie in a wagon exposed to the wind and storm and as I started in the fore part of this history I heard that they were left alone as I supposed and could get no information of them now.

We laid here til the 7th of August and I took a notion to go to Weston, 6 miles above here to trade a little where I found Brother Highins who returned to the Bluffs from the army on the morning of the 24th of July. He presented me a letter from my family stating that they are all well except Sariah which was sick when I left. Also that the Brothers Taners had not left my folks as I heard which gave me great satisfaction and gave great relief to my mind. One think slipped my mind. On the night of the 5 of August  Brother Jailo Hyde, P.P. Pratt and little came to camp which gave great joy to us.

On Thursday we drawed our money. On the 6th day of the month we were all engaged in making arrangements to send money to our families and to the poor. I improved the time and sent thirty dollars to my family and a letter also which means was taken by P.P. Pratt on the morning of the 7th of August.

Now I have come to the 8th of August which was yesterday. Nothing particular took place and I took my little book and began to write this morning, the 9th of the month which is Sunday. I rose early in the morning and commenced to write. It is now ten o’clock and there is a general time of health. Some few are sick. One or two taken to the hospital. On my own part I have reason to rejoice and praise the Lord for my health. I traveled and carried my knapsack from 16 to 20 miles a day and endured the journey beyond my expectations, being of a slender constitution and some of our healthy, rugged men were taken sick every day or two. We had from 10 to 15 in the wagons. 

At once its enough to try the feelings and rend the heart of man that has any degree of feelings or sympathy for human beings to see them suffering under the power of disease and rolling around on the ground and in wagons rolling over rough roads and bridges without anything that is nourishing or comfortable for food or lodging. Great and good are the feelings of God that he has made a way possible whereby we can come to Him and be saved and redeemed from death and suffering. Surely might the Savior mourn and weep over the distress and sufferings of a nation that was doomed to destruction, not that I think this the case with us, but knowing what we have suffered by  oppression gives a foresight what must be the end of the oppressors. We as a people having an appearance of the event of things that are not yet made manifest can look upon the fallings of nations and consider the consequences that must necessarily attend while we can see hear and feel the sufferings and of our people as we travel through the world as strangers and pilgrims as not know yet well known as dying, yet we live as poor, yet we are rich as possessing all things as forsaken. Yet we are comforted and administered unto so we need to be comforted and take joyfully the spoiling of our goods in hopes of a more glorious resurrection when the groaning of the sick will cease. The cries of the widow and the fatherless heed one away, and peace and happiness cover the face of the land.

It is now twelve o’clock in the 9th day of the month on Sunday and we expect to hear a discourse from Lieutenant Dyres this afternoon at the four o’clock. The brethren gathered together a goodly number of them. We had a very interesting discourse upon conducting ourselves in all wisdom and prudence, not suppose that because we were in the army of the United States that are commonly practiced under such circumstances, but showing ourselves afraid of God in all things.

The morning of the 10th  August has appeared warm and pleasant and the camp in a general state of health. On the 15 day of August we left Fort Levensworth. Took up march for the West. Came to Strangers Creek 25 miles from the Fort. Thence to Bansus  River. The 16 we passed through the Delaware and Raw Indians. Here we came to a point where we stopped two or three days, and there came a storm and the wind and blowed of a good many wagon covers and tipped over one and one near 20 rods. Blowed it over. The weather turned off mild and pleasant. We left this place the 22 of August. Came to the Oregon Road, 6 miles, to Santa Fe Road, 9, Elm Grove, 3 miles where we stayed overnight. Rock Creek seven miles creek 110. Thus far it is mostly prairie, no timber, only on the creeks. Switzer Creek-8, BeaverCreek-16, do the same-1,5  do the same- 6, do the same-5, do the same –7, do the same –6, Big John Spring-5 miles, counGrove-2. we laid by here three days in which time John Baswick and his wife died. She on the 28, he on the 30th day of August. Here was a Handsome grove of timber and fine country and some part of this country on the road is fine and beautiful.

On the 31 day of August we left here. Traveled over high rolling prairie. Crossed Rock Creek to Diamond Springs16 miles, one creek 1,5 miles and a half from the Spring. Do 1,5 Lost Spring 12 miles where we camped. Cottonwood Fork 14 miles, Turkey Creek 8 miles, do three miles, do 4 miles, do 3, do 3. Little Creek 18 miles, Buit Creek 10 miles, Little Cow Creek 5, Big Cow Creek 4, Elm Creek 17 miles, Valnut Creek 6 miles,  Ass Creek 20 miles, Pawne Fork 5, Arkansas Run 11 miles, crossing Arkansas Crossing 45 miles.

We came to this place on the 15 of September, a march of one month through a country of prairie. Little or no timber, hardly enough to do our cooking. We saw a good many buffalo and killed a good many. Their meat is very palatable, full equal to beef or better. A night in this time we had to cook our supper with buffalo dung. We laid by here at Arkansas one day.

On the night of the 16 of September  I wrote a letter to my wife having an opportunity to send it back the next morning. Here the families that came along with us parted and went up to BentsFort, from there to Fort Larimy to winter no timber across to Santa Fe into a dry barren prairie with no timber, water very scarce. We traveled 60 miles and carried our water, saves a little. We got out of little/ bundles on the night of the 19 of September. We came to what is called the Simeron Creek 60 miles from Arkansas River. The next morning to the Simeron Spring, distance of the 20 of September up the Simeron bottoms traveled several days and had to dig for our water every night. This creek is called the Simeron yet it is dry and has the appearance of an extensive water course anciently.
	
We followed it until we came into a broken country where it had every appearance of the head of an extensive river that once ran through a beautiful pleasant country. One would hardly think of it being of ancient curiosity without the understanding of the Book of Mormon. The rocks and hills denote something of ancient revolutions of the earth. In passing through this country and reflecting on the history of the Book of Mormon one can discern the overthrow of a country that has been once beautifully populated, now lays a dry barren desolate country which will make a man of serious reflections lonesome and homesick.

After leaving Simeron we came to the Cold Spring where we camped for the night. The branch water and where we dug for water on the Simeron. The water tased similar to salt and would work on the bowels moderately and we could see the resemblance of salt on the hand and on the sand. I often thought of Sodom after leaving the Cold Spring the 25 of Sept.

On the 26 we passed Seder Spring, came to MacMiriserSpring where we camped for the night. The next day passed the Cottonwood Spring about noon. Came to Rabitears Creek and camped on the 29 of September. On the 0 day passed a large high mound. Came to Rock Creek where there was nothing for the cattle to eat. We ate our supper of fresh meat and traveled 6 miles and camped for the nigh t. It was near 10 o’clock started the next morning before breakfast. Traveled 3 miles. Stopped in a narrow bottom on the first day of October for breakfast. Here again I discovered every appearance of once a beautiful and large stream of water. The holes and crevices in the rocks denoted the working of water that once run through a beautiful country, but now a dry and barren desolate desert. Here Brother Hyde and Dykes went 2 miles from the road and saw 2 walls that showed ancient workmanship from 8 to 10 feet between them. Had the appearance of an ancient building.

The second day of October we passed the point of rocks in the morning where there was a beautiful steam. Camped for night. On the morning of the 3rd we came to Oute Creek. Here from the express we received from General Carna, our commander, who thought it best to divide the battalion and take the best teams and the strongest men and hurry to Santa Fe to prepare to go over the mountains and  leave the sickly and the weak teams come up with more care. This plan was agreed on with the officers which caused great sorrow. I was one to take the force march.

For two to three days past we have been in sight of scattering timber but very scarse. We traveled 10 or 12 days. No timber in sight. We cooked our provision with buffalo dung. Here on the 3rd of October as I stated on the other page, we arranged for parting. Started about one hour before sundown. Marched 18 miles, stopped about midnight by the Wagon Mountain. Very tired and fatigued. The next day marched 18 miles. Camped on a small creek where there was abundance of rock and pine shrubs.

In the morning we marched 5 miles. Came to a house on the Rio Mora River. Here we came to groves of pine timber on the ledges and small mountains. On the 6th of October we came to ---abagus, the first town. The next was Colota, 4 leagues or 12 miles. Marched 6 miles from this place. Camped near to small town. Next morning went 7 miles. Came to San Migil. We were three days passing through the divides of the mountains and through  the valleys.

On the 8th day of October we passed the narrows where the Spaniards mustered 7,000  men against General Corna. He drove them back without the firing of a gun. On the 9th we marched into Santa Fe. These Spanish towns and cities are built of sundried brick about 8 inches wide and a foot or over long. They are mixed with straw. They have no form or order in building or in the streets. Their buildings make me think of a brickyard. Here our head officers have made the arrangement for the sick and feeble to go back to Fort Pirbelows to winter and also the families that are here and to start early in the spring for California and meet us at the erpese of government. This city is said  to contain 7,000 inhabitants. Their mud buildings are scattered over a good deal of ground and is said to be six miles around it. The inhabitants have not much enterprise; are lazy and indolent and of a dark Indian color. They have two Catholic churches here. The outside looks like a pile of mud the bretheran that have been into the inside say they are neatly finished on the inside. The people here have to turn the streams out of their course in little ravines to water their crops on the account of there being little or no rain in this country. They raise very good wheat and decent corn and beautiful onions. They also have large flocks of goats and sheep, use cows and oxen which seem to be the principal part of their living. They use a great deal of goats milk.

This contains a broken history of the country and of my travels up this date, which is the 16th of October. On the 19th of October we left Santa Fe. Took our journey down the river Rio Des Moines. Traveled 6 miles. Camped for the night. Started the next morning. Traveled 14 miles. Camped near a little town called Banaleo. The next day past  Sandea and  struck the River Dellnort and came into the bottom of the river which was dry and traveled in the sand, which traveling for several miles came to Qualotro.

24th of October. This day we wasted. The 25th of October came to Avor Cakey. Same day past Norrilba, same day Parecas. Camped near a place called Dighlaitras. 26th past Loana, past Canaldona, one called Thomay, past on the 27th Chave and Naly Solvanade. 28th past a large place called Sandenoak. On the 29th camped near a place called Pulvarearo. On the 31st Looparira one called Souckquarus. On the opposite side of this place is a place called Sadina.

The first of November past through a place called Nloupus. This is the last town. We past River Rio Pelln, the country of a poor sandy soil. The people keep large flocks and herds and herd their stock and farm without fences. The country hilly and mountainous. The people live in towns and in mud houses one story and roofs nearly flat.

On  the 2nd of November we left the road leading to Chevaway. Took to the right down the Rio Grande River where there was no road but a trail that had been traveled with pack mules. Traveled on til the 4th of the month. Camped for the night. Rested. On the morning of the 4th of November brother by the name of Hampton in Company A was buried.

On the 24 of October we was reduced to three quarters of a pound of flour to a man a day, three quarters ration of pork shinjar and coffee pound and a half of beef. On the 1st of November we was reduced to one half pound of flour for a day. Other rations as yet remain as before stated.

Form this date, the 5th of November, I should endeavor to keep my history better,. Arranged circumstances have rendered it quite difficult up to this time to keep all things correct.

The morning of the 6th of November has appeared warm and pleasant. We took up march on our journey. After one day’s lonesome, barren and desolate, uninhabited. We traveled this day til 2 o’clock and camped on the river called the Rio Grande. A long range of mountains on the opposite side and some small banks that show the appearance of salt that has lost its ____tive. The country shows the appearance of conventions and revolutions and antient desolutions according to the history of the Book of Mormon. It is evidently the case, for truly the land is desolate, lonesome and barren and seems to be in almost every kind of disorder; mountains, hills, and points of curious organization.

This, the 7th of November, we marched through sandy hard traveling and no road. Got along very slow for several days. November 8th which if Sunday, we marched 7 miles and camped. The country is yet desolate and lonesome. Nothing looks natural but a few cottonwood trees are scattered along the river. We have no road. The pilots look it out as we travel along. It is sandy, hard traveling. We have to push at the wagons which makes it tiresome and on half rations which makes it still worse. The north we marched over rugged barren hills and two small bottoms, nothing to be seen but hills and vales. Lonesome and desolate. No animals to be seen, not so much as should not think that any live thing would stay here no longer than it would take them to get away

On  the evening of the ninth the way got so bad and leads so heavy we received orders from the Colonel to have all the sick and weakly fitted out with 26 days provisions and one wagon, 5yoke of oxen and sent back to Santa  Fe or Pirbelow. On the morning of the 10th we made ready as fast as possible and started little after noon. Came 4 miles and camped. 53 in number. Rose on the morning of the 11th, made ready and started. Came on a piece and two more sick seemed to be improving and we made a move forward. There is now three sick with the measles and I greatly fear the company that’s gone on will have serious times with them. On the morning of the 13th we made ready and started. The sick seem to be improving. My health is tolerable good but we got where we had got to go to packing mules and I had hired my knapsack carried but the prospect of hirering failed and there was no way for me to get it carried but to buy a horse or a mule and I had borrowed so much money to send back to my family that I could not pay for one and I had  been subject to a lame breast and I thought it not wise for me to undertake to carry a knapsack of 10 or 11 pounds on my back 600 or 700 miles, but to leave the breathern was grevious to me and against my feelings. If I could got a horse to ride it was my choice to gone on to  New Mexico November 13, 1846. 

November 14 we rose in the morning prepared to march and started early. The sick walked along slowly. I still feel grieved to part with the battalion and had I a horse I should go on to overtake them. We got along very slow. Our team is poor, the sick are weak.

November 15 before breakfast prepared and started. One man very sick. We went to put him into the wagon. We thought he was dying and we laid him on the ground again. He came to. We took him on a blanket and carried him up the hill near a quarter of a mile. The road being sandy the load heavy. There we put him in and started. The day is cloudy and cool. Some rain and I set under a cottonwood tree near the Rio Grande River, New Mexico. The man that I spoke of this morning that  was sick died ten o’clock in the wagon, and being in 6 miles of the place where we buried Brother Hampton, we thought we would carry him along and buried them together. So I with six others was selected to go ahead and dig his blanket and wrapped him up and put him into the ground. Put down some poles to keep the dust off from his and filled up the grave and left. It is now 7 o’clock in the evening and firelight. November 16 the morning is clear and cool but pleasant. Some of the men are quite sick and taken sick last night. The days pass off lonesome and melancholy. The men are feeble and we get along slow and we have no way to make them comfortable.

November 17th the morning is cool and cloudy. We are making our way up the Rio Grande River to Santa Fe. The sick seem to be improving except Alisha Freemone. He is very sick. I yet feel lost and lonesome with pasting with the brethren. I had much rather gone with them then to return back if I could got a horse without taking all my wagons which I knew my family needed. So by the counsel of Captain Hunt and Lieutenant Clark I consented to come back. We past a little slew that was so salty that we could not use it. The latter part of the day was cold and snowy.
 
November the 18th the morning is cold but pleasant. We are camped in the woods on the Rio Grande River. Some of the men are very sick. The days pass lonesome and sorrowful. My desire is and was to go with the battalion if I could gone without being made a pack mule of, to go back is against my wish.

O solitude where are thy charms in days and hours in lonely meditation. My mind has roamed in the scenes and in thy borders is not to be found the sevets of a contented mind. And peace is not to be found in thee. Why should my mind roam on these lonely hours while God rules and gives His spirit to His saints for the best. In thy will I put my trust. Give me thy spirit oh God. Keep me in thy arms of love and safety. And in thy cause I will be content.

In New Mexico on the River Rio Grande I am tented on the ground. At Council Bluff I expect my family is to be found. In God I must put my trust and in the sweet influence of His spirit a rest and with joy and gladness say to God all things work together for the best. It is now 2 o’clock. It’s a day of rest with us.

November 19th. The day is cold by pleasant. The mountains are covered with snow. The valleys are bare and cattle are grazing. Alisha Freemone and William Carter are very sick, nigh unto death and no way to be made comfortable. How sad the moments pass and in a strange and desert land.  Alisha Freemone died today at half after 12 o’clock November 19th.  Near sundown he was entered here in the plains far form his friends and his wife so dear.  Must the blooming youth sleep and rest.

November 20th. Last night one o’clock Richard Porter died, was buried this morning at seven o’clock. Brother Freemone and Brother Carter was buried between Neboafins Souckquoarns. Brother John  Green and Brother James Hampton was buried 24 miles south of Neboafins.

November 21st. The morning is cool but pleasant. The sick seem to be improving at present. It is our daily prayer that there will be no more deaths in our midst for truly it is grevious to see our bretheran left b y the side of the road. We started the morning, traveled 5 miles and camped to secure our teams and to get some more oxen and another wagon to help us along.

November 22nd. The morning is fair and pleasant. The sick still seem to be improving. The Missouri soldiers have a good many sick among them and a good many die. We passed Howgoon near 10 o’clock in the morning, camped by the side of a little stream that was very salt, so much so that we could not use.

November 23rd. Started this morning traveled three miles past Sand Nual. The morning id warm and pleasant. Some cloudy. The sick are improving I think, but the time passes lonesome and sorrowful. We stopped today and camped about two o’clock to let the teams feed and rest. Our teams are poor and weak.

November 24th. Started this morning at 7 o’clock. It very cold but pleasant. We passed Jalriamade and Nalay and Charea. We traveled today hear 10 miles and our teams are about to give out. The weather is cold and wood very scarce, hard to be got at all. The people are not willing to sell it.

November 25th. We rose this morning early. It was cold and Disagreeable. The sun rose pleasant. Got ready and started. Passed Thronia. The day is cold but pleasant. We traveled til two o’clock. Passed through an Indian Town Cavoldona. Quite a large town. They have houses of sundried brick. They look quite comfortable. The latter part of  the day is pleasant and warm and I sit on the side of the road on the ground close to the town with my pen in hand writing. The Indian’s town that I spoke of the Pirbelow Indians. We are now fixing for camping one quarter a mile from the town. The evening is quite warm and pleasant.

November 2 6th. Started this morning little after sunrise. Passed through a little town Loona by the Dighlaitva. The day is pleasant but rather cool. Our teams are poor and tired, nearly tired out. Sick. Lame and halt. Have to carry their knapsacks and gun and equipage. It is slow getting along. We crossed the River Rio Grande not far from 3 o’clock and came into Alvorcapey and camped for the night. There was 300 regulars quartered for the winter. They were very friendly to us.

November 27th. The morning is quite warm and pleasant. We started at 9 o’clock. On our way another man by the name of Mackey is taken sick with the measles. Surely it is an unpleasant lonesome time with me. We came through Quatoutro. Here there is scattering settlements along for several miles. We camped near this little town sun near one hour high.

 November 28th. Started this morning at sunrise. The day is warm and pleasant. The health of the bretheran seem to be improving. As I pass the country I see many children naked as they were born into the world. Some are very sick and some very poor. Generally very ignorant.

November 29th. Cool and cloudy. Passed a little Indian town on the River Giodelnost where we first struck the river on the 21st of October when we went down. 

November 30th. The day is cloudy and misty but with warm. The sick seem to be improving but are quite worried and fatigued by traveling and carrying their knapsacks. 

December 1st. the morning is cloudy, windy and cool. Very little snow. Some of our men are quite sick yet, some very much fatigued with hardship. We are in ten miles of Santa Fe. Arrived to Santa Fe at 3 o’clock. It was windy and cold but very little wood. We were very uncomfortable.

December 2nd. The morning is pleasant but very cold. The health of our men is improving. It is very sickly here. The Missouri volunteers die from six to ten is a day. All kinds of wickedness is prostilized here. When we came here on the ninth of October there was only 12 deaths. There is now upwards of seventy.

December 3rd. this morning we have to take eight of our men at the hospital for we can’t get of it out to take them on. It is grevious to us. The time looks gloomy  and melancoly. The post is in the command of Colonel Price of Missouri and a great many Missouri volunteers here. They have no interest nor feeling for our comfort or ease. I feel as though it was a time of serious reflections with me. My heart is pained my soul is grieved. There is all kinds of feelings and discord in this little company. It seems as though all union has fled.

December 4th. We got our miles today and prepared to start. We got only ten miles to pack for 54 men and 8 of them sick and no chance to ride. Yesterday we expected to leave them in the hospital, but they would not let us and we have to start with them. The sick mourn and suffer, our hearts are filled with grief and sorrow. It looks gloomy and sorrowful. A man by the name of Marquis Eastman told me that he would not carry loading for no man. He had a mule and he would not go afoot to comodate anybody. If a man  was dying he should not get on his mule for he would not accommodate God almighty. I told him he showed a noble disposition. If I had a rule I would carry the loading for the sick and go afoot myself. Well he would be damned if he would. Said I, you will see the time you will want a favor.

December 5th. The morning is unpleasant and snowing and we have to go back to Santa Fe 5 miles after one of our sick men and we have to start for there is no feed here for our mules.


December 6th. The morning we was under the necessity of leaving twelve of our sick men for we had not the animals to carry them. We left them to move slowly along as they could stand it and we would hurry along and make arrangements and send back for them. We are under the necessity of doing it or all perish for we have only 12 days rations to go 250 miles on foot and pack mules and through the mountains. It’s a time of sorrow and mourning with me to see the distress and sorrow of the sick. These hearts are broken. They are wore out. They mourn and weep. It seems as though all favor had fled. Oh God, where is the tender feelings of man. They are gone. The sick are in care of Thonius Rurns. He says he will be kind to them.

December the 7. This morning is very snowy and disagreeable. We started past several Indian’s towns of the Pirbelow Indians. They are very kind.

December 8th. This morning is cold. The snow is from four to six inches deep. We traveled through the mountains where there was just room enough to go with pack mules. We are gathered in a Spanish house, warm and comfortable.

December 9th. This morning is cold but pleasant. We are in a comfortable house in Lamb Boolyer. It is surrounded with mountains. We attended a fandangotut night with the Spaniards. They carried on the scene very decently and are very friendly. Eli Dodson is very sick with the measles. We shall stay here today.

December 10th. This morning is cold and tedious but we started but we had to leave Eli Dodson sick and very sick. The time looks dark and gloomy and as our bretheran was to be scattered all over New Mexico. The mountains are covered with snow. I am now in a notch of the mountains.

December 11th. We have been climbing mountains for two days. It is very tedious and tiresome. I am nearly tired out. We came to Jouse today and camped.

December 12th. We had to leave Brother Colmon today. He is very sick. We have had to climb the mountains today swift and rigid.

December 13. Came into a valley. Traveled 12 miles. Camped. It was cold and windy.

December 14th. Traveled all day in a valley in the mountains. A very large and extensive valley. Antelope, hundreds in a flock. We had not more than half rations enough to last us through just a night. We came across two fat beavers in our travel which was fortunate for us.

December 15th. Yet in the valley. Traveled 18 miles, camped on a little creek. It is very windy and cold. Good many of us have had colds.

December 16th. We are yet in the valley of the mountains.

December 17th. Came into the notches of the mountains today. We are camped in the notch of the mountains.
	
December 18th. This morning is very cold and the ground covered with snow but we started. Left the head waters of the Rio Grande River and took over the mountains. The snow is from 6 to 18 inches deep. Some places drifted from 2 to 3 feet deep. It was cold and severe traveling over. One boy froze his toes. We made a fire on the tope of the mountains to warm. One man gave out in consequence of the trek. W. Rust and  myself put him on a horse that Brother Rust had come over on the east side of the mountain into the pine timber. It was much warmer. We traveled till night and camped on the head waters of the Arkansas for the night. The weather is more mild.

December 19th. This morning is more pleasant and no snow and only 6 miles from the mountains. Traveled til night. Four of us came to a house where there was some eastern men.  Some of them had Spanish women for wives. The rest of our men tired out and could not get up. It seems as though our Lieutenant wanted rush ahead if every man died. No feeling on his part could be shown to poor worn out men.

December 20th. This morning is warm and pleasant. Myself, J. Wolsey, William Rust, Lieutenant Willes started early so as to reach Pirbelow a distance of 25 or30 miles. Brother Rust and myself fell behind as we had but one horse between us. We got into Pirbelow at dark and was kindly invited into the quarters of Brother Cylines, William Walker, and Rastus Ringum and are with them yet. Some of our men did not get intil [should be “until”] on the third day after we got in. We were all tired out, wore out when we got here. This is a sketch of my travels to this time, December 24th.

After staying with my family from the 15 of February to the 7th of April I started again with the pioneers to go to the mountains and from there to go to the army. Crossed the horn on the tenth of the month. The twelve returned back to Winter Quarters and the company traveled on 14 miles to camp til they came up. They came up on the 15 day of the month and on the 16 we started.

On the 20th of the month we passed the Pawne Indians. They appeared quite friendly. On the 22 we camped at the missionary settlement. On the 24 we crossed the loop fork of the Platt after crossing we traveled on 2 miles and camped for the Sabbath.

The 25 of the month a pleasant and beautiful day. On the morning of the 26 we was called by the alarm, the guard having reported that Indians was near. One of the guard shot at one. We got our breakfast and started. Camped on at night on a little creek. Brother Title and Brother Richards lost a horse a piece that was taken by Indians. Porter Rockwell and three others went back the next day after them and was met by 15 Indians. On the 27 we started, traveled till near night and camped on a handsome little creek about ten miles north of the Platt. On the morning of the 28 we rose and got ready to start. It is fair and pleasant. We came to the Platt River, traveled up a piece and camped.

The 29th is a pleasant day. The 30 day is cold and windy. The first day of May is a cold rain windy day. About noon one saw a hard of buffalo and started out some hunters on horses. They took after them and killed six big ones and six calves. On the morning of the 2nd of May we got up and the night had been so cold that water in own buckets was froze half inch thick. Water in the slew was frozen but the sun rose quite pleasant and warm.

May 3rd. We started traveled two miles which in on Sunday to get feed for our cattle and horses. The night was so cold that ice froze in our buckets again. We are laying by today to repair wagons and wash which is Monday, the fourth of May.

The fifth and sixth were quite pleasant days. We passed several herds of buffalo. Killed one cow and several calves and caught two alive. It is now the 7th of the month which is May. The day is warm and pleasant. May 7th we are camped on the bank of the Platt River. This morning is windy and disagreeable. The feed is getting low on the account of the extensive herds of buffalo. Some of our teams are giving out. 

May 8th. It is a warm and pleasant day. We are stopped for noon on the bank of the Platt River and the ground on both sides of the river is covered with buffalo and they come up within thirty or forty rods of our wagons.

May 9th. Is Sunday. We started and traveled three miles to find feed for our teams. The feed is very poor on the account of the numerous herds of buffalo. They eat it out. The day is warm and pleasant and we are stopped to rest.

May 10th. This morning was cool. We started at nine o’clock traveled til noon. Stopped to bate. It is now warm and pleasant. We traveled along very agreeable all in union. 

May 11th. Is warm and pleasant day. We traveled til the middle of the afternoon and stopped for our teams to feed and we had found better feed than we have had for several days.

May 12th. The morning and evenings are very cool and the middle of the day is warm and pleasant. We get along very slow on the account of the feed being ate cut by the buffalo. Leaves it very poor for our teams.

May 13th. As usual we started at 8 o’clock. It is windy and cold all day. We camped at night on a handsome shallow creek little above where it emptied into the north fork of the Platt. We are now up the north fork nearly 17 miles.

This morning is the 14 of May. Is cool and cloudy. Looks like rain and thunders. We are now where there is no wood and we have to use buffalo dung for fuel and for cooking. The feed for our cattle is getting better and I feel in hopes we shall get along some faster this morning. Before we got ready to start it began to rain and was so cold that our horses shook with the cold. We passed over a bluff. It was generally sand and the face of it had been shifted and changed by the wind.

May 15th. Is a cold and windy day with some rain. Today we passed through another bluff that the wind had blown in heaps and blown holes in the ground from three to five feet deep and several rods long. When we went down the bluff we went down in a place that the wind had blown out wide enough for a road and the sand was 8 or 10 inches deep. When we got down came onto a beautiful green bottom of grass and we stopped and bedded our teams. Our hunters have killed nine buffalos in all and a number of calves.

May 16th. Is a cold windy day and disagreeable day. It is on Sunday and we are lying by and have little or no wood and the buffalo dung is so damp  it does not burn very well. We are camped a quarter of a mile from the north fork of the Platte and a good many buffalo came in sight this morning on the bluffs a half mile from our camp. One of the hunters killed one just at night.

May 17th. We started this morning traveled over a bluff of a couple of miles distance and came on to the bottom again. The feed was extinct and traveled on three or four miles, crossed five handsome little spring brooks and stopped to bate and sent a wagon to bring in a buffalo that one beautiful little spring branches and the hunters killed two more buffalo. We are camped for the night and formed in a circle as is our custom of camping . Feed is getting very good and our teams are improving.

May 18th. This morning we started as usual. The forepart of the day was warm and pleasant. We traveled 15 miles, crossed two creeks, stopped for night on a little creek that came from the bluffs which are near half a mile from the river.

May 19th. We started as usual but it is a wet stormy morning. We crossed the point of a bluff of three quarters of a mile which the wind had blown in holes and drifts. It was very hard for our teams to draw our loads through. We traveled til near noon and had to stop on the account of the rain for and hour at two and started again and traveled two miles. Had to stop again and camped for the night.

May 20th. This morning we started as usual. The day being pleasant we traveled along on the bank of the river, crossed two creeks traveled 15 miles and camped for night.

May 21st. We started this morning at the usual hour. Had very traveling. Bated at noon, traveled til four o’clock in the afternoon. Stopped for the night and a Sioux Indian and his squaw came to us, stayed a few minutes and went back to the bluffs.

May the 22nd. As usual we started, traveled along on the bottom of the north fork of the Platte til the middle of the afternoon when we came to the point of a bluff that came to the river.

We crossed two dry creeks before we came to the bluffs. We rose the ____ which was principally sand and gravel. We crooked around between the hills for two miles, crossed a dry creek in the bluffs three times. Was so crooked we also had to turn around the hills and hollows. Came through the bluffs crossed two small dry creeks and came onto the river bottom again. Still the bluffs were on our right two miles from the river composed of hard clay and rocks, very broken high and steep. Some nearly round and very high, some small points towering up from40 to  50 feet. Today as we were traveling along we found a piece of a bone that had been the shoulder blade of some animal supposed to be the mammoth. It was 18 inches long, 12 inches wide at one end. The small end was 6 inches wide, 6 inches thick. We found a leg bone 18 inches long, 4 inches thick, a piece of it only was found. Their bones were petrified as hard as a stone and was as heavy.

George Ryrant and Horace Whitney and one or two more went into the bluffs and climbed the tree and took a young gray eagle from the nest and brought it to camp. It was considerable of a sight. 

May 23rd. Is on Sunday and we are lying by and are camped. Camped about two miles from the bluffs. Though I have been describing meeting is appointed at 11 o’clock as is our custom to have meetings every Sabbath. Many of the breathern have gone and are going to see the curiosity of the bluffs. We have had a very interesting discourse from President Young and Erastus Snow today at sundown. The wind rose and began to rain and turned very cold and was a tedious night.

May 24th. The morning is cold and windy. We started as usual. It cleared off pleasant and warm. We traveled 16 miles and a half, camped for night and a company of Indians came across the river to us a piece. Our camp is a bluff of curiosity.  At a distance it looks like a round two story house with a dong on the top. The Indians that came to our camp last night stayed all night a little distance from us. The chief took supper with Porter Rockwell and his squaw also and stayed all night. Went away in the morning peaceable and friendly. They were sons (sic).
	
May 25th. We started as usual, traveled up the Platte bottoms through some very wet hard traveling. Traveled 12 miles and camped for night. 

May 26th. Started this morning, passed the chimney rock which is on the south side of the river and other bluffs and banks of curiosity. The hunters kill four antelopes today.

May 27th. This morning being pleasant we started as usual traveled eight miles and bated an hour and a half. Traveled 5 miles and camped. It clouded up and thundered and is beginning to rain.

May 27 (sic). This morning is cloudy and raining. After waiting a couple of hours we started, traveled 11½  miles and camped for night. It is still cloudy.

May 28th. This morning is wet and rainy. Is cool and very unpleasant. We are waiting for it to clear away. The rain cleared and the weather looked more favorable and we got our teams ready to start. A meeting was called by President Brigham Young. He reproved the camp for the light and trifling spirit that prevailed in their midst and for playing cards and excess of dancing and said he would not go any further unless a covenant was made to do better. A vote was called and unanimously carried. We started half past one, traveled eight miles. It began to rain again and we camped for night.

May 29th. Is on Sunday and the camped are getting ready for a fast meeting and to partake of the sacrament. The day is to be spent in fasting and prayer and the twelve are to be in counsel by themselves.

May 31st. I have missed one day in my book. The morning has been very pleasant. We started as usual traveled nine miles and a half. Stopped for noon as usual. Traveled along we passed on our right sand banks from 25 to 30 feet high which had been blown up by the wind. After dinner we started, traveled til nearly sundown to find feed, it being very poor we came to a creek and camped. I give it the name of Graving Creek.

June 1st. this morning we started as usual. Stopped and bated on the bank of the river. Traveled in afternoon til sun two hours high and came to Larimer, being 540 miles from winter Quarters, being 2800 miles that I have traveled since the 16 of last July, 1846 to this day, June 1st, 1847.

June 2. we are now camped on the bank of the Platte and shall be here three or four days to wash and do some blacksmithing.

[The following pages are a transcript of five small journals kept by Arza Adams.  Some parts of his journals were kept as daily entries, and other parts were apparently summaries of time periods.  The separate books appear as sections in this compilation.

The originals of these journals are deposited in the BYU library, and the pages reproduced herein are xeroxed from them.  Our family has never had a transcription of these journals, and so far as we know, there has not been one made before.  Parts of them were summarized and quoted in a life sketch I wrote of Arza Adams last year for our family. .	.  .	Effie W. Adams, December, 1979]

[page 1] Arza Adams, born January 22, 1804, and baptized into Jesus Christ by Elder Jo [John] Page, December 25, 1836, and Sabina Adams, my wife, baptized on the 26th and both confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by the laying on of hands.  And I was called to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation from God, and separated for the ministry by the hands of Elder J. [John] E. Page and A. Stevens on the 3rd of June, 1837, and soon began to preach the word of life unto my acquaintances and friends and continued to preach and settle up my affairs until the spring of 1838 when I started with my family, consisting of wife and four children, to the land of Missouri where the Lord had appointed for the gathering of the [page 2] kingdoms and nations to serve the Lord and wait for the coming of the Son of Man.

And we arrived at DeWitt, Carroll County, September 26, 1838.  But soon surrounded by a mob, we was driven into Caldwell County, 63 miles to the main body of the Saints.  But the mob raged and Governor Boggs, willing to show the mob favor, gave orders to drive all the Saints out of the state, killed about 22 and we all left the state.

And myself and family left Far West on the 7th of March, 1839, came to Illinois about 200 miles, took a small farm, put in a good crop and left it and my family in the care of my brother, Barnabas Adams.  And borrowed 25 dollars from him and started for Canada, my native place, to settle up my affairs and preach the gospel of Christ to my own kin and nation. [page 3] Took the parting hard with my family.  About four miles from Quincy, Adams County, on the 11th July, 1839, and went by the way of Saint Louis and Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Buffalo and Louiston [Lewiston, New York] and landed in Brockville, [New York], Tuesday, the 30th July.

Arrived at my father's near Perth [Ontario, Canada] on the 2nd August, [1839], and after settling some of my affairs, rested myself and visited.  I started to Kempville [Kemptville, Ontario, Canada] on the 21st [August, 1839], arrived there on 22nd and preached in the evening to a relation's place; started to find Brothers Merkley and Snow, preached at T. Smith's on Sunday, the 25th, in Kempville [Kemptville, Ontario, Canada] on 27th, more peace.  Held meeting at Smith's on the 29th in company with M. [Merkley] and S. [Snow] on the 30th.  Laid hands on T. Smith for the toothache.  And on Monday, 1st September, [1839], preached at Grandy's [and] McFadden's to very large congregation and good order.  Then started to find more places to preach and arrived at Father's on the 4th [September, 1839], and continued to arrange [page 4] my business and preach to the scattered branches in this quarter until the 2nd October, [1839].

Started again to See Elders M. [Merkley] and S. [Snow].  Visited some of the brethren and others by the way and preached at Belameys Mill on the 6th, on the 7th [October, 1839], at Ogdensburg [New York].  Found Brother Chapene strong in the faith though...perhaps not just...  Tuesday, arrived at William White's on the nation, preached in the evening.  Little disturbance for the Wesleyans had shut the schoolhouse against me, but we went to another about a mile and a half and the Lord was with me and I gave out another appointment for the 16th [October, 1839], and arrived at Peters's on the 9th.

At Grandy's and Halley's on the 10th and found them believing and near the kingdom.  Went to Smith's on the 11th, found M. [Merkley] and S. [Snow] and all well.  Seven had been baptized and two more, Brother Grandy and his wife [page 5] baptized on Saturday, the 12th October, [1839], and three more on the following Sunday and Monday.  And I preached at Brother Grandy's on the 13th and preached at William McCangason Tuesday, and while many listen, many more began to rage and they brought one of B... priests to confront me in my teaching, William Anderson, a Presbyterian.  And after telling some lies and making a poor fist of it, I closed my meeting.  But I preached on the first principles with liberty and the Lord was with me so that I could not be confounded by any man preaching for hire.  And some of the people said he had better stop at home if he could do no better.  And I think it will be a caution to him.

But on the 9th, I called on Mr. John Adams of Wesleyan Methodist and asked the privilege of preaching in the schoolhouse, and he said I should not and turned [page 6] away and left me without giving me the reason for it.  And I told them in the house that inasmuch as he had shut me out, it might be said inasmuch as he had done it unto the least of one of these he had done it unto Christ, and left them to work out their own damnation with greediness.

On the 16th [October, 1839], traveled about 15 miles to Mr. White's; preached in the evening to a large congregation and the Lord was with me.  But the Methodist priest and their ... warned them faithfully not to hear me.  The Lord reward him according to his works.  But on consequence of the hard words in the neighborhood, it was thought best not to preach there again at present.  But some are partly believing and William White's family are very kind.

On the 17th came [page 7] to the Widow Mott's and find them partly believing and spoke to them the word of the Lord, and find I can preach in this neighborhood.  The way opens well.  Traveled to H. [Hiram] Mott's on the 18th and find a place here to preach and a home when I call.  Arrive at Father's on the 19th and find them all well and find a letter from my family which gives me much comfort to hear that they are all well and I pray to God the Eternal Father to keep them and me in health, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  Amen.

20th [October, 1839].  Met with the little branch and encourage them to go on in the Lord, and on the 27th, preached to them again on the gathering and an excellent time we had in the Lord.  And I now stay at Father's a few days to get some clothes made for winter and am at work on his mills.

On the 3rd [November, 1839], spoke to [page 8] little branch again and partook the sacrament.  Elders Mott, Bolton, and Nichols were present.  We had a good time in the Lord and we were encouraged to hold on.  I told them that the man was the head of his family and God would judge him if he did not keep his place and the wife her place, for I thought that some of the brethren were visited by their wives and their children and thus I fed them in the discharge of my duty to them for the present.

And Friday, the 8th [November, 1839], I started down to Bathy [Bath, Ontario, Canada] to fill some appointments and Saturday evening preached at Hiram Mott's to a small congregation and on Sunday traveled about 11 miles to the Widow Mott's and preached to a good congregation but they are very hard.  Monday evening met a few at Louises Conner's and spoke many things to them and some of them appeared [page 9] well pleased for Wellington Louis raised some opposition, he being a Methodist.  But his wisdom and prudent understanding soon vanished away before the truth of the gospel, and I showed the congregation that the Methodists did not worship the God of Israel, but the gods of nations.  And I preached in that neighborhood several times and removed much prejudice from minds of the people and visited several during my stay.

One family by the name of Peter Cameron, his wife sent for me to come and see her and when I arrived she had many accusations against the Church, but I told her they were false.  And I preached Christ to her and I soon found that conviction had fastened on her and she attended meeting and said I preached the truth.  It was on the first principles [page 10] from lst Galatians, and I pray God to take care of them in my absence.  Oh, that they might be convinced unto obedience.

I than visited Mr. Holks again and found him a very stiff Methodist and he wished me not to preach in his schoolhouse again, and I then showed him that he was not of God from the scriptures, for he did not pay attention to the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.   And I now feel not to preach much more in this place for they are nearly all Methodist and are too dishonest and will not see the truth and come unto Christ that they may live; for they would rather follow their traditions to hell than to believe and obey Christ.

On the 16th [November, 1839], I returned to H. [Hiram] Motts', preached twice in that neighborhood on Sunday, once at J. Dack's and once at Mott's, and on Monday, the 18th, started to Perth [Ontario, Canada] and to [page 11] Father's where I worked about ten days, at the same time waiting for some winter clothes which I had making in Perth.  Met with the little society and encouraged them to be faithful and start to Zion as soon as possible.

On Saturday, the 30th November, [1839], left Perth [Ontario, Canada] in company with Brother A. West for Kithy.  Arrived at Hiram Mott's in the evening and found him still believing and a few others.  Preached at J. Doak's [Dack's] schoolhouse on Sunday and was opposed by J. Barny, a Methodist, which only served to throw more light on the subject, and he appeared very angry and called me liar and many hard names.  But I showed them that I did not lie and that he did not tell the truth.

Monday evening preached at Mr. Washburn's on Genesis 37:10 to a large congregation.  Tuesday, went to Smith Falls [Smiths Falls, Ontario, Canada].  Preached in the evening to large congregation and a Presbyterian minister, Lon [Jon] Ebenazer Bell, tried [page 12] to disturb the congregation.  I gave him a lashing and called the authority to keep order and I understood that Mr. Loucks even shook his hand at him and we had order after that.  Although Mr. Loucks tried to prevent me from preaching in the schoolhouse occupied as a meetinghouse by the Church of England and Methodist and in charge of a Mr. Matheson, an old friend of mine that gave me permission.  And the Lord preached to them, and not I alone, on the first principles.

May it be found many days hence and not having an offer of the house and a place to stop, for I requested it, I traveled about nine miles to H. [Hiram] Mott's.  I met with a few this evening and spoke on many subjects.  And on Wednesday evening at J. Dack's several came in to hear me speak on the things of God and appeared to be well satisfied.  Preached on [page 13] Sunday at Dack's S house [schoolhouse] to a large congregation on false teachers.  Some mad and some pleased, but the Methodists foamed.  And in the evening, the 8th, December, 1839, baptized Hiram Mott and a number gathered around and some acted out what they were within.  And thus the devil rages at the work of God.  Several more are well convinced but keep back for some reason.

9th [December, 1839].  Traveled about ten miles to the W. [Widow] Mott's and preached to a few, and the widow appears to be very friendly and makes me welcome, and I say the Lord bless her and the two girls of Brother Mott's.

10 [December, 1839].  Traveled to Louises Conners where I expected to preach, but the Methodists had a pow-wow and voted that I should not preach, so they have rejected the gospel and I leave them.  And it is my conclusion that the sects are getting up to their zenith [page 14] and also the political affairs of the province are in a prosperous and flourishing state and all appear to look for a long life and fine times, while I say that they are preparing for a great downfall and a mighty destruction and that speedily such a one as the Gentiles never saw in Canada.

11 [December, 1839].  Traveled about ten miles to A. Curtis's.  They wished me to preach.  I do so on Friday evening at the ... S house [schoolhouse].  No liberty, they appear to think more of this world than of the God of Israel.  Done some business in Brockville [New York].  Stayed all night with Uncle L. [S.] McEathanon.  He would not receive my testimony.

Preached at A. Curtis's on Sunday, the 15th [December, 1839], to a large congregation.  Not very soft pride and the love of the world prevails.  Traveled about seven miles to Father Baxter's.  They are very hard; will not accept my testimony.

16 [December, 1839].  Traveled to my aged friend, Mr. White's house, about 12 miles.  They are looking at it [page 15] some, but do not take much pains, rather stuped.  I preached twice in this neighborhood and they concluded not for me to preach again and I think it is a chance if ever they have the offer of the gospel again; but I pray to God to reward them all according to their works.  And William White's family often refreshed me, the Lord bless them.

17 [December, 1839].  Traveled to Mr. Lyons and mountain to Brother Grandy's.  Conversed with many in the neighborhood but they are very hard, priestcraft aplenty, but there are a few that think Mr. Anderson with whom I had a debate told a lie and I think he told two lies.  But he wishes to uphold his craft, for by it he gets his gain.  I conversed with many hereabouts and waiting for Elder Merkly [Merkley] and Snow at Brother Grandy's and expect a meeting tomorrow, Sunday, 22 [December, 1839].  The principal part of the branch met at Brother Grandy's, together with Elders Snow and Merkly [Merkley].  By the consent of the branch, we ordained a priest, S. [Silas] Willcox.

[page 16] We had an interesting time.  The branch now consists of about 16 and the greater part enjoy themselves well and the Saints begin to rejoice to see the latter days.  (By common consent, Silas Willcox ordained a priest.)  And in the evening after meeting, rode in a sleigh with brethren and sisters, singing and rejoicing as we went about 15 miles, giving out an appointment for Christmas Day, the 25th, at H. Smith's.

Visited many of the brethren waiting for the time and on the 25th [December, 1839], a goodly number met and I preached to them on the priesthood and many saw it clear.  Brother Snow addressed the congregation after me and in the evening, held a prayer meeting.  Very good time.  E. S. [Elder Snow] baptized Joseph Barker and we laid hands on the sick and blessed the children in the name of the Lord, and after we rejoiced in the Lord, the God of Israel; and thus in part, God's prophecy is fulfilled, for the Saints begin to dream dreams and see many wonderful things and their dreams from both the young and the old are very plain and conclusive, showing the [page 17] ... of the wisdom of men and that Jeremiah's prophecy is fulfilled in that the Gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth and shall say our fathers have inherited lies and thus concluding that the Lord's way is best.

26 [December, 1839].  Traveled seven miles, preached in the evening at Henderson's on 18th chapter [of] Revelation, showing many things concerning the kingdom, the Methodists ...

27 [December, 1839].  Traveled five miles, visited some; conversed with Mr. Salsbury and offered the order of the kingdom to him but he was hard and rejected it.  Stayed all night at ... in company with E. M. [Elder Merkley], his brother-in-law, and my travels up to this date, December 28, 1839, is about 2477 miles since I left Quincy, Illinois, on my mission on the 14 July, 1839.

28 [December, 1839].  Traveled four miles to ...

29 [December, 1839].  Traveled three miles Sunday, preached at the Conner's to a few on the priesthood.  They have had much preaching here and some have brothers and sisters here yet.

30 [December, 1839].  Traveled in to Father Merkley's.  They are very kind.  The Lord reward them for their kindness.  Here Brother Snow parted with us.  He went to Vermont.

[page 18] 31 [December, 1839].  Traveled eight miles down the River St. Lawrence to John Casleman's [Cassleman, Casselman].  Preached in the evening on 2 Peter 1:20 and conversed with them after.  Found some believing.  Brother Snow and Merkley had preached here before.  Gave out some appointments and on the 1 January, 1840, crossed the river, traveled five miles to Peddington Mills.  Preached in the evening on first principles and stayed at A. Stevens'.

2 [January, 1840].  Traveled five miles to Bannard.  Brother M. [Merkley] and myself preached here.  B's family appeared kind and believing.  The Lord held them.

3 [January, 1840].  Traveled five miles to the mills [Peddington Mills] again.  Preached to a large congregation.  Very attentive.  Preached on the priesthood.  Some began to see and think we are right.

4 [January, 1840].  Traveled five miles, crossed the river.  It is about two miles wide.  Ferried over by J. [John] Cassleman [Casselman].  Traveled three miles and preached in the evening to a large congregation and the power of God was present and very convincing and I hope some good may be done.  A fine time and much of the [page 19] love of God in my soul.  Preached on first principles.  Preached at John Empey's and gave out an appointment for Sunday, the 5th [January, 1840].  Preached at 2 o'clock on the Book of Mormon.  Had a good time.  Traveled three miles to John Cassleman's [Casselman], very friendly, the Lord reward them.

While we were over the river, some on the Canada side said that we could not come over, for the ice had put out into the river on both sides and the ice running very swift.  But as we came to the river, the ice seemed to break off from both shores and floated downstream and we had no difficulty in crossing.  Thus, the Lord opens the way.

6 [January, 1840].  Preached at John Cassleman's [Casselman] in the evening on Genesis 31:10 and the time was convincing and a friendly converse after.  Many convinced but are holding back.

7 [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles, preached at John Empey's on Hebrews 5:4 on priesthood.  The Lord made it convincing to many.  Traveled seven miles, stayed at William Empey's.  Traveled three miles, preached at J. [John] Cassleman's [Casselman].

Preached on the 8th [January, 1840], on second coming of Christ.  A good time, for six came forward and said they would be baptized and the Lord was with us and I baptized them. [page 20] Their names are John Cassleman [Casselman], William Empey, John Morison, Nicholas Empey, Ellen Cassleman [Casselman] and Maria Empey.  After which Brother Merkley and myself confirmed them by the laying on of hands.  In all it was a good time and we all rejoiced.

9 [January, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Nicholas Empey's.

10th [January, 1840].  Traveled four miles, preached in the evening to a large assembly at Shapops Sh city.  Very attentive.  Preached on first principles.  Traveled eight miles to Brother Cassleman's [Casselman].

11th [January, 1840].  Rested, not being very well.

12 [January, 1840].  Sunday, preached in the evening to about 200 on restoration.  Very still.  Traveled three miles, preached at J. [John] Empey's and many are believing here.

13 [January, 1840].  Traveled one mile, preached at Mr. John Eamon's on many things.

14th [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles, preached at Brother Casselman's [Cassleman] on first principles, Galatians l:8.  The congregation was very large and I preached about three hours, after which a Mr. Ralf, a Church of England minister, addressed them and a poor hand he made of it and when I began to show his folly, he interrupted me and he said I preached the truth, yet I was deluded.  [page 21] I told him that if I preached the gospel, he must repent and be baptized for the remission of sins and he would not stay to receive a lashing.  And I bid him a good evening and the congregation, being detained a long time and uneasy while some person or persons threw several pieces of iron at me, some of which struck the stove very hard but missed me.  Thus I am preserved and all glory belongs to the Lord.  And I then dismissed them but while many believed, the devil raged in others and a Mr. Nackerville, a Methodist, preached against the Book of Covenants, calling me by name in public, stating that I was an imposter.  And it appears that he or the Methodists wish to get me into a shave or into their meetings in order to abuse me and not to give me no chance to reply to them.  But the Lord keeps me clear yet and I have given out that I will meet him on fair principles.  But it appears it is foul play they want.

Br. John Cassleman's [Casselman], where I last preached, lives [in] Williamsburg, county of Dundees [Dundas], and Mr. John [page 22] Empey lives in the township of Osnechnook, county of Dundees [Dundas], Eastern District.  Thus I rested on 15th [January, 1840], and on 16th, traveled eight miles, preached on the gathering from Matthew 24:37, after which a Mr. Lile, a Presbyterian minister, came forward and wished to ask some questions and said he would behave like a gentleman.  He asked me if I opposed infant baptism and I replied that I would with all my heart.  He said he would treat it then.  He threw down two or three bundles of books and made a few observations and we concluded to adjourn until the 21st, the evening being far spent and the house cold.  Traveled four miles to Brother Nicholas Empey's, stayed all night.

17th [January, 1840].  Visited Brother John Morison, then we went to Brother William Empey's and some others gathered in and we had much conversation.  Interesting, and traveled in all four miles.  Rested the 18th at Brother E [Empey's].

19th [January, 1840].  Preached at J. [John] Empey's at 12 o'clock p.m. and he did not want preaching there anymore, for it appears that a Mr. Linsey, a Church [page 23] of England minister, had sent for him and persuaded him that we are wrong.  And thus I see that many will believe the strong delusions or false stories rather than believe the Bible.

Traveled three miles, preached at Brother Casselman's [Cassleman] at 6:00 in evening on priesthood.  And I understand that it is the opinion of Mr. Linsey that the Mormons are sent by the Lord as a scourge to the Methodists; he not liking them as they are quarreling about the loaves and fishes on clergy reserves, and some hereabouts would be glad to have the big Mormon's head knocked off, i.e., mine, and several mobs have threatened me behind my back, but all is well yet.  And one, Phillip Empy, it is said, threatened to put a ball through any Mormon's heart that enters his door.  He is very full of Methodism.  The Lord save me from such religion.  And some say that I have run away from my family.  And almost all evil is said of me and is started by the Methodist preachers and kept in motion by their dupes, and [page 24] thus they are filling up their iniquity and desolation is nigh, yet they will not believe.

20 [January, 1840].  Traveled five miles in company with some brethren to the Cooper schoolhouse to the great contest before agreed on with Mr. Lile.  I preached on the priesthood from 2 Corinthians 5:20, after which I proposed a chairman, a Mr. D. Lang, and Mr. Lile chose Mr. Thomas Mackswell.  I than proposed a given time to speak and half an hour was agreed on.  I then proposed as I had advanced nothing but scripture to support my doctrine, that nothing but the same should be brought to refute it.  It was agreed to by the chairmen.  Then his bundle of books was cut off and he commenced.

But instead of upholding his mode of baptism, he undertook to refute my arguments on priesthood, for I had preached about two and a half hours.  His objections, however, amounted to nothing, for he did not produce one passage of [page 25] scripture against me but assertions like these:  no ambassador since the apostles and defied the most learned critic to show any of the New Testament lost.  In my reply I used 3 chapter Ephesians and I said it would be as easy to see Christ now as for Paul.  He said not addition.  I said on this principle no addition after 4th Deuteronomy and showed them that the Lord had promised more.  He said the Bible are the keys of the kingdom, yet he said the New Testament was not written then.  I said a ... key before it was made.  I had before shown what it was.

He then said there was no priesthood since Christ and he was all the priest we wanted to know.  I then asked him why they wished to palm a deception on the world by still ordaining to the priesthood if there is none.  It could be for nothing but to get a fat living and palm a deception on the world and I advised the congregation to be aware of such deception and abominable priestcrafts, for it is the craftiest of all crafts.

[page 26] And the people began to be uneasy and the chairmen said they would not act any longer and the chips began to come briskly over to where I stood, the door being taken off the hinges, and the stove pipe fell and quite a quarrel ensued.  But I think I had the majority in my favor, but while they were quarreling, we came out, unperceived by the mob that had gathered to drive the Mormons, the head of which was a commissioner by the name of Jack Empy.  Thus the devil rages and the bands begin to draw tight around the times and they begin to squirm.  Thus, according to my request, in a measure the evil spirits were bound so that we came off safe and traveled five miles in a sleigh with the brethren to Brother Empey's.

22 [January, 1840].  Traveled one mile, preached at Mr. Amon's on signs and miracles.  Stayed all night.  They are believing, but appear to be afraid of the cold water or something else.

23 [January, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Cassleman's [Casselman] and Brother Merckly [Merkley] baptized Mary Ann Empey and Almyra Cassleman [Casselman] and in the evening confirmed them.  Had a good time.

24 [January, 1840].  In the evening Mr. Ralf, a priest of Luther preached against [page 27] me, after which I gave out an appointment for Sunday, the 26th.  After which I told them I would show that he was one of the harlots and that he had no authority to preach.  He behaved almost like anything else but a gentleman and as soon as I commenced talking, he would talk to prevent me from saying anything.  I then told him that the work we are at in gathering Israel is the deliverance out of Zion and I told him to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins and he should receive the Holy Ghost.

Rested 25th [January, 1840].  On 26th preached at 2 o'clock p.m. on false teachers and in the evening Brother Merckly [Merkley] baptized Margaret Morrison, after which she was very happy.  Confirmed her in the evening and many stayed through the whole and many are believing and now I wait to meet Luther's priest again on Wednesday next.

28 [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles.  Went to hear West... priest Episcopal and I understood that Phillip Empy, in whose house the meeting was, had said that if the Mormons put their feet into his house he would ... not put a ball through their heart. [page 28] However, he looked very cross and they had a great pow-wow, some screaming and screeching, some howling and yelling as though the spirit hurt them very much and smote their fists and stamped their feet and some pounded the benches with their fists.  The preacher's name is West and they threw out many slurs but no proof.

29th [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles and Luther's priest did not meet me for he had been there and told Brother Cassleman [Casselman] that he wanted to withdraw the appointment.  So I preached on the 60th chapter [of] Isaiah.  

30th [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles to Brother William Empey's.  Preached in the evening on Revelation 22:14.  Had a very good time and many believing.  Traveled in all up to the 30th January, 1840, 2,593 miles.

31st [January, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Mr. John Hickey's where I met Mr. Nankerville, a Methodist preacher, to hold a debate and almost the whole county gathered to hear, for he had agreed to prove the Book of Covenants false.  We had regular order, only the chairman, a Mr. Michael Empy, cheated me out of some considerable time.  But our debate lasted about six hours in a very [page 29] good humor, only he made use of foul expressions without proof, such as it is from beneath and imposture.  But he referred to from 25 to 30 pages of the Covenants, yet strange to say not one passage of scripture to the point brought forward to prove the book false or any part of it, and finally it was a jumbled up mess and all he advanced was darkness.  And while I brought forward the Methodist's discipline on several points of it, the groans, the ..., the cries from the Methodists were beyond description and the spirit by which they were activated is only known by the power of light and I find it is hard for any of the paid priests to stand against the truth of God.  But in their ... they try to uphold their craft, for by it they get their gain.  And before I left them, I told them that the hour of God's judgments had come and I ... them to repent, both priest and people, for the day was nigh when their young men should be slain [page 30] in battle and their old men be driven from house to house and fall to rise no more, and their young women be led into captivity and many such desolations are coming on the Gentiles.  And so we closed our debate and went to Brother Cassleman's [Casselman].

Visited on Saturday, the 1st February, [1840].

2nd [February, 1840].  Preached at 11 o'clock from Revelation 6:1, after which four arose and said they would be baptized.  Adjourned until evening and a large number gathered and I felt like preach[ing], although no appointment had been given out, but came to see them baptized.  I preached about two hours from Genesis 6:16-19, after which I baptized David and Catherine Wood and Benjamin Wood and David Levi Empy [Empey] and his wife, Margaret Polly Empy.  And we gathered again in the house and confirmed them by the laying on of hands, after which I nominated a clerk, Brother John Morris, and the members sanctioned it.  I then gave them some considerable instruction [page 31] relative to their meetings, which was agreed on two times a week and through the whole, we had much of the spirit and a fine time.  And they now number fourteen and I took my leave of them recommending them to the grace of God.

3rd [February, 1840].  Started to Father's about 88 miles and Brother John Morison brought me about 20 miles in a sleigh and left Brother Mercley [Merkley] at his father's.  I stayed at Prescott [Ontario, Canada] all night.

4th [February, 1840].  Traveled to the Widow Mott's.  She is a believing.  I also called at Brockville [Ontario, Canada] and got a part of the hymnbooks that I had agreed with Mr. Buell, for he printed 500 for $20 and 20 hymns each.  I was led to this because I had not hymnbooks of our own.  And many were poor and could not well afford to purchase a large one, and I thought the poor had as good a right to sing as the rich.

5th [February, 1840].  Traveled to Brother Hiram Mott's, and here I understand some that believed and had they done their duty [page 32] would have been baptized have since been very sorry that they had not complied.

6th [February, 1840].  Traveled to Father's, 3 1/2 miles above Perth [Ontario, Canada].  Found all well.

7th [February, 1840].  Traveled two miles to Brother Mott's, found them well and had a good visit.

8th [February, 1840].  Traveled two miles to Father's and I am now waiting for a letter from my wife that has been sent to Kempville [Kemptville, Ontario, Canada]; and also resting for a few days, for I have tired myself almost out preaching and traveling.

Sunday, 9th [February, 1840].  Begin to feel rested some, and want to know what my best course is to do the most good and help roll forth the kingdom.

10th [February, 1840].  Visited.

11th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles and still visiting and waiting.

12th [February, 1840].  Traveled sixteen miles to Brother Nichols.

13th [February, 1840].  Traveled fourteen miles to Canthon Place [Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada], feeling impressed to try to find a place to preach.  And this is the second time that I have tried to preach here, but all in vain.  Stayed all night at Mr. Hugh Bolton's.  His wife and wife's daughter are very kind, and if they had a place large enough I could have it.  But meetinghouses, schoolhouses and all [page 33] closed up, and after conversing with some of them on the 14th [February, 1840], took my leave of them, believing their prejudice so great that I cannot get a hearing and traveled thirteen miles to Brother Nichols.

15th [February, 1840].  Traveled fifteen miles to Perth [Ontario, Canada].  Find no letter and from there to Father's.  Stayed all night.

Sunday, 16th [February, 1840].  Met the little branch.  Brother Bottone Brough was there.  We had a good time.  Traveled five miles.

17th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Perth [Ontario, Canada], received a letter from my wife.  All well.

18th [February, 1840].  Traveled fifteen miles to Brother H. [Hiram] Mott's and my wife wishes me to come home as soon as navigation opens and I ... to comply.

19th [February, 1840].  Traveled 27 miles through Brockville [Ontario, Canada].  Stayed at John McEathron's [McEathanon].

20th [February, 1840].  Traveled twelve miles to Prescott [Ontario, Canada] and there I find Brother Hiram Mott and I preached there in the evening in a small place.  The meetinghouse is closed against me as I understood.

21st [February, 1840].  Traveled about eight miles to Ogdensburg [Lawrence, New York] and back to Prescott [Ontario, Canada].  Sent a letter to my wife while in Ogdensburg.  Preached in Prescott in the evening on the first principles at William Bancraft's, but many of them acted as if the withs begin to ... [page 34], for they talked and swore and left the room and some of them stole the key out of the door and my ... broke the ... which rolled ... against the door and locked the door and there was no order.  I concluded that if they would not keep order they should do their own preaching and I left them.

Traveled nine miles on the 22nd [February, 1840] to the S. White's and on my way, visited a Mr. Rude, and I found wife to know much about the Old Testament and she believed the doctrine of Christ on as much as I told her and they wished me to preach there.

23rd [February, 1840], Sunday.  Stayed all day at Mr. White's.  They are very kind and partly believing.  It is a hard time, for it rains ... and it is very muddy and my boots leak and my mind is uneasy about my family and it a hard case, but I must finish my mission.

24th [February, 1840].  Traveled eighteen miles to friend Halley's.  Found two the sisters, Halleys, well and in faith and others believing.

[page 35] 25th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Wilcox's and Smith's.  All well.  Gave out an appointment and preached in the evening to the Church and a few others on the gathering.  They appear to be doing well and trying as well.

26th [February, 1840].  Traveled 26 miles out to the river and down to Brother Casselman's [Cassleman].  This is where I had baptized eleven before and found they were to have a meeting at Brother William Empey's that evening and traveled four miles to it and preached to them, and many others came to hear preaching on gathering.

27th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Casselman's [Cassleman].  Preached on the Book of Mormon in the evening to a large assembly, after which I baptized Brother Thomas Lang and his wife, Mary Lang, and his daughter, Nancy Lang, and Brother Kinsey and his wife, Margaret Morgan, after which I confirmed them and we had a very good time and gave out a meeting for two weeks for a conference at Brother Casselman's.

28th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles.  Preached in the evening at Brother Woods' on Revelation 22:15 to a large congregation.

29th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles and preached at a Mr. Hoophole's schoolhouse at the place where I had the [page 36] debate with Mr. Lile.  They gave good attention and I think good will be done here.  Traveled four miles back to Brother Lang's, stayed all night.   Him and his family are very kind and intelligent and the spirit appears to intimate that Brother Lang must come to the priesthood and will be good in council and a useful man.

Sunday, 1st March [1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Casselman's [Cassleman].  Preached at 2 o'clock to a large assembly and many convinced and the work rolling on, thanks be to the Lord.  Traveled in all up to this date, since I left Quincy on my mission, 2,902 miles.

2nd [March, 1840].  Traveled one mile, stayed at Michael Hickey's.  They are partly believing.

3rd [March, 1840].  Traveled one mile.  Arrived Brother Kinsey's, Morgan's, and Mr. White's, and on the 4th [March, 1840], traveled one mile to Jacob Camons.  I find that many mobs are threatening in this region and the newspapers team with falsehood and abuse against the work of God.  Stayed all night at Brother William Empey's.

5th [March, 1840].  Traveled three miles.  Visited Thomas Amon's, found them [page 37] believing and said she would be baptized but waiting for her husband.  Traveled to Brother D. [David] Woods', preached on Isaiah 41:15.

6th [March, 1840].  Traveled to Brother William Empey's and baptized William Thomas Lang, a son of Brother Lang baptized before.  Traveled in all five miles, stayed all night at Brother Levy Empey's [Levi Empy].  Several came in.  We had an interesting time.

7th [March, 1840].  Traveled five miles, preached in the schoolhouse where Mr. Lile met me.  A peaceable congregation, preached on the coming of Christ.  Here it was said Mr. Lile would meet me again and I said let him come if he pleases and it is said that he boasted that he would meet me at every place where I would preach.  But he has failed several times.  And the neighbors here say that I am the slickest blagguard [braggart] in this part and I suppose Mr. Lile fears that his doctrine and his drunkenness will be exposed, for his system is a system of idolatry.

[page 38] Sunday, the 8th [March, 1840].  Traveled five miles to Brother Cassleman's [Casselman].  Preached on Mt. Zion and Brother Merkley preached at Brother William Empey's and baptized Richard Alt and his wife, Margaret Alt, and Mr. William Alt.  Visited.

Sunday, 15th [March, 1840].  Held a conference at Brother David Woods' at 11 o'clock a.m.  Preached on the priesthood from 2nd Corinthians 5:20, after which it was moved by Chr. Merkley and seconded by David Woods that A. A. [Arza Adams] be appointed president of this conference.  [page 39]  Carried unanimously;  John Morrison, clerk, after which Thomas Lang and John Morrison appointed and ordained elders and William Empey ordained teacher and David Woods ordained deacon, after which the sacrament was administered and 14 children brought forward and blessed.  And then Elder Lang appointed president of the branch and Elder John Morrison appointed vice president and clerk.  Closed and in all had a good time for the power of the most high was with us and many tears shed on the occasion and many hearts broken down.

16th [March, 1840].  Brother Merkley baptized James Whittom at William Empey's.  Traveled to Brother Casselman's [Cassleman] about five miles.  Many followed us for their hearts asked to not part with us and we came to order and held a small meeting and three came forward and I baptized them, viz., John Cramon, Jacob Cramon and Mariah Cramon.  Confirmed them by the water after which five children were [page 40] blessed in the name of the Lord, and three at other times and 14 at conference, in all 22 blessed in this place and 34 baptized, 25 of them baptized by me.  After which we bid them farewell, but the tears flowed from several eyes and they insisted hard on me coming back again, for I told them I must go home.  Traveled six miles with Brother Casselman [Cassleman] in his wagon, then about two [miles] on foot, eight in all to Brother Merkley's father.

17th [March, 1840].  Traveled 20 miles to friend Smith's in mountain through rain and snow.

18th [March, 1840].  Preached at Smith's on the coming of Christ from Matthew 24:44.  Had a great time.  Traveled to Brother Wilcox's two miles, had prayer meeting in the evening.

20th [March, 1840].  Traveled five miles to Brother Grandey's where I expected to preach, but the appointment had not been given out and I now feel at liberty to make the rest of my way to Perth [Ontario, Canada] to get ready to go home.

21st [March, 1840].  Here I parted with Brother Merkley and traveled 17 miles to Mrs. White's. [page 41] Stayed all night.

April lst, [1840].  Traveled 12 miles to Mr. James Fells, a Methodist G. leader, three miles back of Prescott.  Found him very friendly.  Also gave out an appointment for me at the schoolhouse to preach in.  This is great Methodist country.

[page 42] April 2nd, [1840].  Preached in the evening to a large congregation, very still, on the first principles and many believing it and wished to hear me more.

3rd [April, 1840].  Sick.  However, got the strength to go to the schoolhouse, thinking to make an excuse being sick and give out an appointment for Sunday, but I found Mr. Pike, a Methodist preacher, had come to oppose me.  I then got hold of what strength I could from the Lord and spoke awhile on the literal fulfillment of the prophecy, after which Mr. Pike arose and addressed the congregation and told some falsehoods and many misrepresentations and among the rest, the Spaulding story.  And while I replied to him, he and some others, if not priests, wishes to be I should think, made a disturbance and the evil spirit in them showed itself for it was not a drunk spirit.  We continued until near 12 [o'clock], it being in the evening.  However, it drew the necessary division and many wished to hear me through.  Went home with James Felt, the Episcopal leader.

[page 1] The class leader and his wife are very friendly and it appears like a home to me.  And a Doctor Candell that came from Prescott to hear me and is believing stayed with me all night and advised me to take an emetic in the morning.  The 4th of April, [1840], he gave me one and I feel better, although I am still weak.

5th [April, 1840], Sunday.  Preached at 4 o'clock p.m. on the priesthood to a large congregation and many appear to believe.  But the Methodists have the schoolhouse and they are afraid that their craft is in danger and think it best to nip it in the bud and just not give me the house to preach in again.  And their class leader, Mr. Felt, and his wife are still friendly but seek action [page 2] against me.  And I leave and now feel that their love of the world will prevent them from embracing the truth.  And I think that many are believing in this place, but most of them have their affections placed on the world and their minds are darkened by the deceitfulness of this world and seem to act as if this world is their God.  Thus it appears that they fear the Lord by the precepts of men and their graven images and some of them bow before the Lord and I think receive some of His spirit.  But the spirit of the world is upon them, I think at least ten times where the Spirit of the Lord is once.  Thus they are dark and alas for them, for their destruction is nigh at hand and their overthrow is sure.  Thus I leave them.

6th [April, 1840].  Traveled three miles and visited many and told them to prepare for the coming of the Son of God.

7th [April, 1840].  Sent a letter home and one to the Osnabrood Branch and traveled 12 miles to John McEathron's.

8th [April, 1840].  Traveled 15 miles to the Widow Mott's and while in this section, I heard much talk of war and it is expected that Great Britain and China are hard at it and that the Russians will help China and the States and England will soon be at war and so the world is in commotion and Great Babylon will soon come into remembrance before the Lord to reward her for all her abominations and fornications.  [page 3] Roll on thy purposes, O Lord, and let thy saints be glad and shout for joy and give them grace for all the tribulations through which the saints have to pass and give judgment unto the saints and restore the kingdom to its real, O Lord.

9th [April, 1840].  Traveled 12 miles to Hiram Mott's and on my way visited Brother [Joseph] Coad and gave out an appointment for the 10th.  Traveled three miles, preached on the priesthood to a few.  Stayed overnight at Brother Plunket's.

11th [April, 1840].  And baptized Mary Coad, wife of J. C. [Joseph Coad], and Joseph Coad, his son.  And Jane Duck, the convert of J. D. and Laneih Plunkett, the wife of R. P. [Plunkett], after which we returned to the house of Brother Coad and I confirmed them members in the Church of Christ.

We had a fire in the woods by the side of the creek where we baptized and were very comfortable and secluded from the world.  Sister Duck was confined to her bed with a fine daughter about 15 hours after she was baptized and she thinks she received no injury and is doing well and the child, and her faith is strong and is well pleased that she was baptized.

Sunday, 12th [April, 1840].  Preached at Dock's at 11 o'clock on the gathering, after which bid them farewell and traveled three miles to Brother Mott's.

13th [April, 1840].  Traveled to Perth [Ontario, Canada], 15 miles there.  I feel that I have filled my mission nearly at this time and I have baptized 33 in this section and witnessed the baptism of many more and have traveled in all since 12th of July, last, about [page 4] 3,000 miles and now begin to make ready to return home to my family, and continued to make ready until the 6th May, [1840], and then bid my father's household farewell and started home.  Traveled 17 miles to Brother Hiram Mott's, Brother John Nichol with me.

10th [May, 1840], Sunday.  Went to hear a Mr. Burwell and Evningite preach and one of the elders arose and spoke a few minutes, during which he said that the forerunner of Christ, which was John, was to prepare the way for Christ and that ministry was Elias and that Elijah must come again to prepare the way for the second coming.  And Mr. Burwell cried out with a remarkable strange and loud voice; said he had come and it appeared to me that the house was filled with evil spirits and [page 5] although Elijah has come, yet I think that the spirit by which he spoke was an evil one for it brought darkness and fear instead of light and love on the glory of the Only Begotten.  And during the time Mr. B. [Burwell] was preaching, many strong, invective ... thrown upon them that came into this country, Canada, a land of royalty, and stole away the people and took them into a land of lawlessness and led them into the wilderness to give all their prophets to their idol.  They had let up and argued strangely that if we should give away all at once, if the Lord should call for a tithe on a sacrifice, we would have nothing to give.  I think strange logic and stated that it was the devil speaking through them and the Lord would blast it and it would come to naught, for it was the work of the devil.  He said their main child is Christ and the church.

5th [June, 1840].  Traveled 40 miles, traveling four miles east of Quincy.

Found my family well and doing as well as I could expect, being absent from them near eleven months.  And I now commence farming and attending to my business at home.  Nothing of note happened for some time, although I found on my arrival that several of the Twelve had gone to England and doing well, and Elders Hyde and Page had gone to Jerusalem.  After being at home some time and hearing several debates with the great Dr. Nelson and visiting the brethren at Commerce and preached once in Quincy [page 8] on the priesthood.

My family was taken sick and Sidney Moses, the babe, and George, after a severe dysentery of the worst kind, they both fell asleep, the first on Friday, the 7th of August, [1840], and the latter on Sunday, the 9th of August, 1840.  Thus two of my sons are gone and it appears strange, but they have gone from the tribulations of the last days and the rest are not in good health.  Thus, my family is reduced to five in all, two sons and one girl.  Wife and self and many of the brethren are sick and some have died lately, and how great our tribulations will be, I know not, but the Lord's will be done.

About this time, the baptism ... this is about four miles from Quincy, Adams County, Illinois, and here I continued about the 27th of March and my lease is near out, and a Mr. John Powel, from whom I had the lease, became my enemy and prosecuted me for cutting firewood on the land I had leased, and he expected to obtain one hundred dollars from me and the prejudice was high against me, but I pled my case.  And between him and the lawyer up high and caused a great [page 9] court and eight hits on me and I paid it.

And I now start for Nauvoo and arrived there about the 1st of March, 1841.  Here I began to build a house, and about the 5th of August, moved into it, and on the 6th [August, 1841], visited a conference where we had much teaching and all in order.

I immediately purchased a piece of land over the river in the Iowa and fenced it and I also purchased three lots in the city from William Hiliam and I commenced work for the Law and Fosters Stone.

Worked in the winter and then built a cabin on Madison Island and moved onto it for the winter.  Hunted out a larger lot of timber and moved back to the city about the 1st of April, 1842, and commenced building a house for myself on one of my lots.  Moved into it sometime in the summer.

During the summer a ... persecution from Missouri troubled us very much and about this time I sold my place over the river to Hiram Mott, and thus my time was taken up in labor buying and selling.  And about this time, I joined the Freemasons. [End of book #3.]

Their preachers disputed with me and raised their opposition to the word of God to uphold their craft.  Thus, the Lord judge between me and them.

	PIONEER OF AMERICAN FORK, UTAH
	1852

	Source:  Biographical sketch of Lydia Thornton Adams by Cynthia Adams Okey, microfilm of typescript, BYU.

	Lydia Thornton Adams is the daughter of Oliver and Mary Griswald Thornton, born 19 October 1830, at Pickering, Ontario County, Canada.  She was the oldest of twelve children and proud of the fact of being born the year the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was organized.

	Her parents were earnest seekers of religious truth and were much confused at the cry of the many churches of their time of ""Come join us for Here is the way, low here is the way' to receive Christ and be saved.""  Seven years after the organization of the Church, her parents accepted the gospel as taught to them by the missionaries traveling in Canada.  Aunt Lydia was ten years old when she was baptized.

	Early in the spring of 1828, the Thornton family decided to move to the head quarters of the Church at Kirkland, Ohio.  They were bundled into a big sleigh with a fine team of horses and crossed the Great Lakes on the ice.  Arriving in the United States they proceeded direct to Kirtland, Ohio; remaining there three months, they joined the movement westward and went with the Saints to Far West, Missouri.

	In February, 1839, they were driven by mob persecution to leave Missouri and they moved to Bear Creek, near Fairfield, Adams County, Illinois. From here they moved to Hancock County Illinois, and settled on a farm near Carthage.  It was owned by a man named David R. Fales.  They were living here when the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were martyred, 5:30 o'clock, June 27, 1844, by an armed mob with blackened faces.  They heard the gun fire and felt the sad oppression that hung over the country side but did not know what had happened until midnight when the wife of George D. Grant came to their home and told them the Prophet had been killed.

	The Grants lived on a neighboring farm and Mrs. Grant filled with fear had waited until darkness came, then she took her baby and another little one in her arms and went to tell the sad news to the Thornton family.  Brother Grant had gone to Nauvoo to tell the sad news to the Saints there.

	Aunt Lydia's parents took her and their other children to see those great leaders as they lay in state in the Nauvoo Mansion.  These two noble men with their pallid faces, hallowed looking even in death was an incident in her life she never forgot.

	They later moved to Nauvoo and in the spring of 1846, they left Nauvoo with the Saints and went to Iowa.  It was at about this time, Aunt Lydia was married to Edmond Buttler, being about sixteen years of age.

	They remained in Iowa two years, then moved into Lynn County, Missouri, hoping here to find peace and rest from persecutions of mobs and wicked men.  But not so, they were soon forced to move on, this time going 150 miles west settling along the Des Moines River.  Here they engaged in farming and freighting for two years and managed to get two wagons and two good teams of horses, and struggled on to Kanesville, near Council Bluffs, Iowa.

	They stayed here until the spring of 1852, when their one ambition was realized; they were able to go on to Great Salt Lake and join the main body of the Church.  They arrived in Salt Lake City in the fall of 1852.  Brigham Young sent the family to American Fork.  They took up land and built a house where the old Thornton home now stands, east of town.

	Aunt Lydia's mother had six children during the fourteen years they were traveling from Canada to Utah.  Aunt Lydia was with them during all this traveling, persecutions and trying times.  Being the oldest of the children it fell her lot to take a large share of the responsibilities of her mother's burdens.  She also had married, had three children and lost them all and was a widow before she was twenty-two years old.

	Imagine, or think if you can going through such tragic experiences for one so young.  What faith, courage and determination she must have had.  Through trials and sorrow, hunger and persecution she went coming out each time like pure gold tested seven times in a furnace of white heat.  Can we appreciate our pioneer mothers enough, their value, their integrity, their sacrifice for that what they knew to be true.

	The Thornton home in American Fork was cross the road from where Joshua Adams owned land.  While working here, no doubt is how he met, wooed and won Lydia Thornton, for his bride.  For in two years after their arrival here she became the first wife of Joshua Adams.  Being married in 1814, in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City.

	In 1857, the first I remember is that she lived on the north east corner of second north and first west streets, in the big brick house, now owned by Phebe Lynch.  It was here most of all her ten children were born.

	Years later father moved my mother (Mary Hoggard Adams) from the house beside the state road, about one block and a half north and built Aunt Lydia the two story brick home, on the site where we had been living.  This home is now owned and occupied by James T. Larabry.  (1934)

	She proved herself a worthy Latter Day Saint, a tried and true pioneer, a faithful and loving wife, a devoted and affectionate mother.  Her husband was her ideal of manly and saintly perfection.  Her home, her kingdom and her children her life's ambition.  She sought no public duty and to the public she was very quiet and retiring.  But her life was full of good queenly principles worthy of emulation by her numerous posterity.

	She died in American Fork, Utah County, Utah, April 30, 1901.  Being the mother of ten children, Joshua; Lydia Ann; Amos F.; Thomas Ephraim; Alice Melissia; Sabina Clark; Charity Melissia; Joseph Steven; Emeretta and Oliver Marion.  Three of this family are still living at this writing, November 29, 1934, 16 living grand children, 10 dead, 26 living great grand children, 3 dead, and 1 living great, great grand child, making a total of 56 descendants of this noble woman.

Our Pioneer Parents

Oh if I had the words and the power
And could put them into rhyme,
I would write them down on paper
Of your dear parents and mine.

I would tell you of their sorrows,
Of their trials and their joys,
Their anticipation of the morrow --
Gave them courage without alloy.

Did they stand those trials for nothing
With no hope of any reward?
They gladly helped their neighbors
They had faith in a Living God.

Now let us their children
Strive to make our lives sublime,
That they will be glad to welcome us
To live with them all time.

[page 1] Arza Adams, born January 22, 1804, and baptized into Jesus Christ by Elder Jo [John] Page, December 25, 1836, and Sabina Adams, my wife, baptized on the 26th and both confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by the laying on of hands.  And I was called to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation from God, and separated for the ministry by the hands of Elder J. [John] E. Page and A. Stevens on the 3rd of June, 1837, and soon began to preach the word of life unto my acquaintances and friends and continued to preach and settle up my affairs until the spring of 1838 when I started with my family, consisting of wife and four children, to the land of Missouri where the Lord had appointed for the gathering of the [page 2] kingdoms and nations to serve the Lord and wait for the coming of the Son of Man.

And we arrived at DeWitt, Carroll County, September 26, 1838.  But soon surrounded by a mob, we was driven into Caldwell County, 63 miles to the main body of the Saints.  But the mob raged and Governor Boggs, willing to show the mob favor, gave orders to drive all the Saints out of the state, killed about 22 and we all left the state.

And myself and family left Far West on the 7th of March, 1839, came to Illinois about 200 miles, took a small farm, put in a good crop and left it and my family in the care of my brother, Barnabas Adams.  And borrowed 25 dollars from him and started for Canada, my native place, to settle up my affairs and preach the gospel of Christ to my own kin and nation. [page 3] Took the parting hard with my family.  About four miles from Quincy, Adams County, on the 11th July, 1839, and went by the way of Saint Louis and Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Buffalo and Louiston [Lewiston, New York] and landed in Brockville, [New York], Tuesday, the 30th July.

Arrived at my father's near Perth [Ontario, Canada] on the 2nd August, [1839], and after settling some of my affairs, rested myself and visited.  I started to Kempville [Kemptville, Ontario, Canada] on the 21st [August, 1839], arrived there on 22nd and preached in the evening to a relation's place; started to find Brothers Merkley and Snow, preached at T. Smith's on Sunday, the 25th, in Kempville [Kemptville, Ontario, Canada] on 27th, more peace.  Held meeting at Smith's on the 29th in company with M. [Merkley] and S. [Snow] on the 30th.  Laid hands on T. Smith for the toothache.  And on Monday, 1st September, [1839], preached at Grandy's [and] McFadden's to very large congregation and good order.  Then started to find more places to preach and arrived at Father's on the 4th [September, 1839], and continued to arrange [page 4] my business and preach to the scattered branches in this quarter until the 2nd October, [1839].

Started again to See Elders M. [Merkley] and S. [Snow].  Visited some of the brethren and others by the way and preached at Belameys Mill on the 6th, on the 7th [October, 1839], at Ogdensburg [New York].  Found Brother Chapene strong in the faith though...perhaps not just...  Tuesday, arrived at William White's on the nation, preached in the evening.  Little disturbance for the Wesleyans had shut the schoolhouse against me, but we went to another about a mile and a half and the Lord was with me and I gave out another appointment for the 16th [October, 1839], and arrived at Peters's on the 9th.

At Grandy's and Halley's on the 10th and found them believing and near the kingdom.  Went to Smith's on the 11th, found M. [Merkley] and S. [Snow] and all well.  Seven had been baptized and two more, Brother Grandy and his wife [page 5] baptized on Saturday, the 12th October, [1839], and three more on the following Sunday and Monday.  And I preached at Brother Grandy's on the 13th and preached at William McCangason Tuesday, and while many listen, many more began to rage and they brought one of B... priests to confront me in my teaching, William Anderson, a Presbyterian.  And after telling some lies and making a poor fist of it, I closed my meeting.  But I preached on the first principles with liberty and the Lord was with me so that I could not be confounded by any man preaching for hire.  And some of the people said he had better stop at home if he could do no better.  And I think it will be a caution to him.

But on the 9th, I called on Mr. John Adams of Wesleyan Methodist and asked the privilege of preaching in the schoolhouse, and he said I should not and turned [page 6] away and left me without giving me the reason for it.  And I told them in the house that inasmuch as he had shut me out, it might be said inasmuch as he had done it unto the least of one of these he had done it unto Christ, and left them to work out their own damnation with greediness.

On the 16th [October, 1839], traveled about 15 miles to Mr. White's; preached in the evening to a large congregation and the Lord was with me.  But the Methodist priest and their ... warned them faithfully not to hear me.  The Lord reward him according to his works.  But on consequence of the hard words in the neighborhood, it was thought best not to preach there again at present.  But some are partly believing and William White's family are very kind.

On the 17th came [page 7] to the Widow Mott's and find them partly believing and spoke to them the word of the Lord, and find I can preach in this neighborhood.  The way opens well.  Traveled to H. [Hiram] Mott's on the 18th and find a place here to preach and a home when I call.  Arrive at Father's on the 19th and find them all well and find a letter from my family which gives me much comfort to hear that they are all well and I pray to God the Eternal Father to keep them and me in health, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  Amen.

20th [October, 1839].  Met with the little branch and encourage them to go on in the Lord, and on the 27th, preached to them again on the gathering and an excellent time we had in the Lord.  And I now stay at Father's a few days to get some clothes made for winter and am at work on his mills.

On the 3rd [November, 1839], spoke to [page 8] little branch again and partook the sacrament.  Elders Mott, Bolton, and Nichols were present.  We had a good time in the Lord and we were encouraged to hold on.  I told them that the man was the head of his family and God would judge him if he did not keep his place and the wife her place, for I thought that some of the brethren were visited by their wives and their children and thus I fed them in the discharge of my duty to them for the present.

And Friday, the 8th [November, 1839], I started down to Bathy [Bath, Ontario, Canada] to fill some appointments and Saturday evening preached at Hiram Mott's to a small congregation and on Sunday traveled about 11 miles to the Widow Mott's and preached to a good congregation but they are very hard.  Monday evening met a few at Louises Conner's and spoke many things to them and some of them appeared [page 9] well pleased for Wellington Louis raised some opposition, he being a Methodist.  But his wisdom and prudent understanding soon vanished away before the truth of the gospel, and I showed the congregation that the Methodists did not worship the God of Israel, but the gods of nations.  And I preached in that neighborhood several times and removed much prejudice from minds of the people and visited several during my stay.

One family by the name of Peter Cameron, his wife sent for me to come and see her and when I arrived she had many accusations against the Church, but I told her they were false.  And I preached Christ to her and I soon found that conviction had fastened on her and she attended meeting and said I preached the truth.  It was on the first principles [page 10] from lst Galatians, and I pray God to take care of them in my absence.  Oh, that they might be convinced unto obedience.

I than visited Mr. Holks again and found him a very stiff Methodist and he wished me not to preach in his schoolhouse again, and I then showed him that he was not of God from the scriptures, for he did not pay attention to the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.   And I now feel not to preach much more in this place for they are nearly all Methodist and are too dishonest and will not see the truth and come unto Christ that they may live; for they would rather follow their traditions to hell than to believe and obey Christ.

On the 16th [November, 1839], I returned to H. [Hiram] Motts', preached twice in that neighborhood on Sunday, once at J. Dack's and once at Mott's, and on Monday, the 18th, started to Perth [Ontario, Canada] and to [page 11] Father's where I worked about ten days, at the same time waiting for some winter clothes which I had making in Perth.  Met with the little society and encouraged them to be faithful and start to Zion as soon as possible.

On Saturday, the 30th November, [1839], left Perth [Ontario, Canada] in company with Brother A. West for Kithy.  Arrived at Hiram Mott's in the evening and found him still believing and a few others.  Preached at J. Doak's [Dack's] schoolhouse on Sunday and was opposed by J. Barny, a Methodist, which only served to throw more light on the subject, and he appeared very angry and called me liar and many hard names.  But I showed them that I did not lie and that he did not tell the truth.

Monday evening preached at Mr. Washburn's on Genesis 37:10 to a large congregation.  Tuesday, went to Smith Falls [Smiths Falls, Ontario, Canada].  Preached in the evening to large congregation and a Presbyterian minister, Lon [Jon] Ebenazer Bell, tried [page 12] to disturb the congregation.  I gave him a lashing and called the authority to keep order and I understood that Mr. Loucks even shook his hand at him and we had order after that.  Although Mr. Loucks tried to prevent me from preaching in the schoolhouse occupied as a meetinghouse by the Church of England and Methodist and in charge of a Mr. Matheson, an old friend of mine that gave me permission.  And the Lord preached to them, and not I alone, on the first principles.

May it be found many days hence and not having an offer of the house and a place to stop, for I requested it, I traveled about nine miles to H. [Hiram] Mott's.  I met with a few this evening and spoke on many subjects.  And on Wednesday evening at J. Dack's several came in to hear me speak on the things of God and appeared to be well satisfied.  Preached on [page 13] Sunday at Dack's S house [schoolhouse] to a large congregation on false teachers.  Some mad and some pleased, but the Methodists foamed.  And in the evening, the 8th, December, 1839, baptized Hiram Mott and a number gathered around and some acted out what they were within.  And thus the devil rages at the work of God.  Several more are well convinced but keep back for some reason.

9th [December, 1839].  Traveled about ten miles to the W. [Widow] Mott's and preached to a few, and the widow appears to be very friendly and makes me welcome, and I say the Lord bless her and the two girls of Brother Mott's.

10 [December, 1839].  Traveled to Louises Conners where I expected to preach, but the Methodists had a pow-wow and voted that I should not preach, so they have rejected the gospel and I leave them.  And it is my conclusion that the sects are getting up to their zenith [page 14] and also the political affairs of the province are in a prosperous and flourishing state and all appear to look for a long life and fine times, while I say that they are preparing for a great downfall and a mighty destruction and that speedily such a one as the Gentiles never saw in Canada.

11 [December, 1839].  Traveled about ten miles to A. Curtis's.  They wished me to preach.  I do so on Friday evening at the ... S house [schoolhouse].  No liberty, they appear to think more of this world than of the God of Israel.  Done some business in Brockville [New York].  Stayed all night with Uncle L. [S.] McEathanon.  He would not receive my testimony.

Preached at A. Curtis's on Sunday, the 15th [December, 1839], to a large congregation.  Not very soft pride and the love of the world prevails.  Traveled about seven miles to Father Baxter's.  They are very hard; will not accept my testimony.

16 [December, 1839].  Traveled to my aged friend, Mr. White's house, about 12 miles.  They are looking at it [page 15] some, but do not take much pains, rather stuped.  I preached twice in this neighborhood and they concluded not for me to preach again and I think it is a chance if ever they have the offer of the gospel again; but I pray to God to reward them all according to their works.  And William White's family often refreshed me, the Lord bless them.

17 [December, 1839].  Traveled to Mr. Lyons and mountain to Brother Grandy's.  Conversed with many in the neighborhood but they are very hard, priestcraft aplenty, but there are a few that think Mr. Anderson with whom I had a debate told a lie and I think he told two lies.  But he wishes to uphold his craft, for by it he gets his gain.  I conversed with many hereabouts and waiting for Elder Merkly [Merkley] and Snow at Brother Grandy's and expect a meeting tomorrow, Sunday, 22 [December, 1839].  The principal part of the branch met at Brother Grandy's, together with Elders Snow and Merkly [Merkley].  By the consent of the branch, we ordained a priest, S. [Silas] Willcox.

[page 16] We had an interesting time.  The branch now consists of about 16 and the greater part enjoy themselves well and the Saints begin to rejoice to see the latter days.  (By common consent, Silas Willcox ordained a priest.)  And in the evening after meeting, rode in a sleigh with brethren and sisters, singing and rejoicing as we went about 15 miles, giving out an appointment for Christmas Day, the 25th, at H. Smith's.

Visited many of the brethren waiting for the time and on the 25th [December, 1839], a goodly number met and I preached to them on the priesthood and many saw it clear.  Brother Snow addressed the congregation after me and in the evening, held a prayer meeting.  Very good time.  E. S. [Elder Snow] baptized Joseph Barker and we laid hands on the sick and blessed the children in the name of the Lord, and after we rejoiced in the Lord, the God of Israel; and thus in part, God's prophecy is fulfilled, for the Saints begin to dream dreams and see many wonderful things and their dreams from both the young and the old are very plain and conclusive, showing the [page 17] ... of the wisdom of men and that Jeremiah's prophecy is fulfilled in that the Gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth and shall say our fathers have inherited lies and thus concluding that the Lord's way is best.

26 [December, 1839].  Traveled seven miles, preached in the evening at Henderson's on 18th chapter [of] Revelation, showing many things concerning the kingdom, the Methodists ...

27 [December, 1839].  Traveled five miles, visited some; conversed with Mr. Salsbury and offered the order of the kingdom to him but he was hard and rejected it.  Stayed all night at ... in company with E. M. [Elder Merkley], his brother-in-law, and my travels up to this date, December 28, 1839, is about 2477 miles since I left Quincy, Illinois, on my mission on the 14 July, 1839.

28 [December, 1839].  Traveled four miles to ...

29 [December, 1839].  Traveled three miles Sunday, preached at the Conner's to a few on the priesthood.  They have had much preaching here and some have brothers and sisters here yet.

30 [December, 1839].  Traveled in to Father Merkley's.  They are very kind.  The Lord reward them for their kindness.  Here Brother Snow parted with us.  He went to Vermont.

[page 18] 31 [December, 1839].  Traveled eight miles down the River St. Lawrence to John Casleman's [Cassleman, Casselman].  Preached in the evening on 2 Peter 1:20 and conversed with them after.  Found some believing.  Brother Snow and Merkley had preached here before.  Gave out some appointments and on the 1 January, 1840, crossed the river, traveled five miles to Peddington Mills.  Preached in the evening on first principles and stayed at A. Stevens'.

2 [January, 1840].  Traveled five miles to Bannard.  Brother M. [Merkley] and myself preached here.  B's family appeared kind and believing.  The Lord held them.

3 [January, 1840].  Traveled five miles to the mills [Peddington Mills] again.  Preached to a large congregation.  Very attentive.  Preached on the priesthood.  Some began to see and think we are right.

4 [January, 1840].  Traveled five miles, crossed the river.  It is about two miles wide.  Ferried over by J. [John] Cassleman [Casselman].  Traveled three miles and preached in the evening to a large congregation and the power of God was present and very convincing and I hope some good may be done.  A fine time and much of the [page 19] love of God in my soul.  Preached on first principles.  Preached at John Empey's and gave out an appointment for Sunday, the 5th [January, 1840].  Preached at 2 o'clock on the Book of Mormon.  Had a good time.  Traveled three miles to John Cassleman's [Casselman], very friendly, the Lord reward them.

While we were over the river, some on the Canada side said that we could not come over, for the ice had put out into the river on both sides and the ice running very swift.  But as we came to the river, the ice seemed to break off from both shores and floated downstream and we had no difficulty in crossing.  Thus, the Lord opens the way.

6 [January, 1840].  Preached at John Cassleman's [Casselman] in the evening on Genesis 31:10 and the time was convincing and a friendly converse after.  Many convinced but are holding back.

7 [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles, preached at John Empey's on Hebrews 5:4 on priesthood.  The Lord made it convincing to many.  Traveled seven miles, stayed at William Empey's.  Traveled three miles, preached at J. [John] Cassleman's [Casselman].

Preached on the 8th [January, 1840], on second coming of Christ.  A good time, for six came forward and said they would be baptized and the Lord was with us and I baptized them. [page 20] Their names are John Cassleman [Casselman], William Empey, John Morison, Nicholas Empey, Ellen Cassleman [Casselman] and Maria Empey.  After which Brother Merkley and myself confirmed them by the laying on of hands.  In all it was a good time and we all rejoiced.

9 [January, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Nicholas Empey's.

10th [January, 1840].  Traveled four miles, preached in the evening to a large assembly at Shapops Sh city.  Very attentive.  Preached on first principles.  Traveled eight miles to Brother Cassleman's [Casselman].

11th [January, 1840].  Rested, not being very well.

12 [January, 1840].  Sunday, preached in the evening to about 200 on restoration.  Very still.  Traveled three miles, preached at J. [John] Empey's and many are believing here.

13 [January, 1840].  Traveled one mile, preached at Mr. John Eamon's on many things.

14th [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles, preached at Brother Casselman's [Cassleman] on first principles, Galatians l:8.  The congregation was very large and I preached about three hours, after which a Mr. Ralf, a Church of England minister, addressed them and a poor hand he made of it and when I began to show his folly, he interrupted me and he said I preached the truth, yet I was deluded.  [page 21] I told him that if I preached the gospel, he must repent and be baptized for the remission of sins and he would not stay to receive a lashing.  And I bid him a good evening and the congregation, being detained a long time and uneasy while some person or persons threw several pieces of iron at me, some of which struck the stove very hard but missed me.  Thus I am preserved and all glory belongs to the Lord.  And I then dismissed them but while many believed, the devil raged in others and a Mr. Nackerville, a Methodist, preached against the Book of Covenants, calling me by name in public, stating that I was an imposter.  And it appears that he or the Methodists wish to get me into a shave or into their meetings in order to abuse me and not to give me no chance to reply to them.  But the Lord keeps me clear yet and I have given out that I will meet him on fair principles.  But it appears it is foul play they want.

Br. John Cassleman's [Casselman], where I last preached, lives [in] Williamsburg, county of Dundees [Dundas], and Mr. John [page 22] Empey lives in the township of Osnechnook, county of Dundees [Dundas], Eastern District.  Thus I rested on 15th [January, 1840], and on 16th, traveled eight miles, preached on the gathering from Matthew 24:37, after which a Mr. Lile, a Presbyterian minister, came forward and wished to ask some questions and said he would behave like a gentleman.  He asked me if I opposed infant baptism and I replied that I would with all my heart.  He said he would treat it then.  He threw down two or three bundles of books and made a few observations and we concluded to adjourn until the 21st, the evening being far spent and the house cold.  Traveled four miles to Brother Nicholas Empey's, stayed all night.

17th [January, 1840].  Visited Brother John Morison, then we went to Brother William Empey's and some others gathered in and we had much conversation.  Interesting, and traveled in all four miles.  Rested the 18th at Brother E [Empey's].

19th [January, 1840].  Preached at J. [John] Empey's at 12 o'clock p.m. and he did not want preaching there anymore, for it appears that a Mr. Linsey, a Church [page 23] of England minister, had sent for him and persuaded him that we are wrong.  And thus I see that many will believe the strong delusions or false stories rather than believe the Bible.

Traveled three miles, preached at Brother Casselman's [Cassleman] at 6:00 in evening on priesthood.  And I understand that it is the opinion of Mr. Linsey that the Mormons are sent by the Lord as a scourge to the Methodists; he not liking them as they are quarreling about the loaves and fishes on clergy reserves, and some hereabouts would be glad to have the big Mormon's head knocked off, i.e., mine, and several mobs have threatened me behind my back, but all is well yet.  And one, Phillip Empy, it is said, threatened to put a ball through any Mormon's heart that enters his door.  He is very full of Methodism.  The Lord save me from such religion.  And some say that I have run away from my family.  And almost all evil is said of me and is started by the Methodist preachers and kept in motion by their dupes, and [page 24] thus they are filling up their iniquity and desolation is nigh, yet they will not believe.

20 [January, 1840].  Traveled five miles in company with some brethren to the Cooper schoolhouse to the great contest before agreed on with Mr. Lile.  I preached on the priesthood from 2 Corinthians 5:20, after which I proposed a chairman, a Mr. D. Lang, and Mr. Lile chose Mr. Thomas Mackswell.  I than proposed a given time to speak and half an hour was agreed on.  I then proposed as I had advanced nothing but scripture to support my doctrine, that nothing but the same should be brought to refute it.  It was agreed to by the chairmen.  Then his bundle of books was cut off and he commenced.

But instead of upholding his mode of baptism, he undertook to refute my arguments on priesthood, for I had preached about two and a half hours.  His objections, however, amounted to nothing, for he did not produce one passage of [page 25] scripture against me but assertions like these:  no ambassador since the apostles and defied the most learned critic to show any of the New Testament lost.  In my reply I used 3 chapter Ephesians and I said it would be as easy to see Christ now as for Paul.  He said not addition.  I said on this principle no addition after 4th Deuteronomy and showed them that the Lord had promised more.  He said the Bible are the keys of the kingdom, yet he said the New Testament was not written then.  I said a ... key before it was made.  I had before shown what it was.

He then said there was no priesthood since Christ and he was all the priest we wanted to know.  I then asked him why they wished to palm a deception on the world by still ordaining to the priesthood if there is none.  It could be for nothing but to get a fat living and palm a deception on the world and I advised the congregation to be aware of such deception and abominable priestcrafts, for it is the craftiest of all crafts.

[page 26] And the people began to be uneasy and the chairmen said they would not act any longer and the chips began to come briskly over to where I stood, the door being taken off the hinges, and the stove pipe fell and quite a quarrel ensued.  But I think I had the majority in my favor, but while they were quarreling, we came out, unperceived by the mob that had gathered to drive the Mormons, the head of which was a commissioner by the name of Jack Empy.  Thus the devil rages and the bands begin to draw tight around the times and they begin to squirm.  Thus, according to my request, in a measure the evil spirits were bound so that we came off safe and traveled five miles in a sleigh with the brethren to Brother Empey's.

22 [January, 1840].  Traveled one mile, preached at Mr. Amon's on signs and miracles.  Stayed all night.  They are believing, but appear to be afraid of the cold water or something else.

23 [January, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Cassleman's [Casselman] and Brother Merckly [Merkley] baptized Mary Ann Empey and Almyra Cassleman [Casselman] and in the evening confirmed them.  Had a good time.

24 [January, 1840].  In the evening Mr. Ralf, a priest of Luther preached against [page 27] me, after which I gave out an appointment for Sunday, the 26th.  After which I told them I would show that he was one of the harlots and that he had no authority to preach.  He behaved almost like anything else but a gentleman and as soon as I commenced talking, he would talk to prevent me from saying anything.  I then told him that the work we are at in gathering Israel is the deliverance out of Zion and I told him to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins and he should receive the Holy Ghost.

Rested 25th [January, 1840].  On 26th preached at 2 o'clock p.m. on false teachers and in the evening Brother Merckly [Merkley] baptized Margaret Morrison, after which she was very happy.  Confirmed her in the evening and many stayed through the whole and many are believing and now I wait to meet Luther's priest again on Wednesday next.

28 [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles.  Went to hear West... priest Episcopal and I understood that Phillip Empy, in whose house the meeting was, had said that if the Mormons put their feet into his house he would ... not put a ball through their heart. [page 28] However, he looked very cross and they had a great pow-wow, some screaming and screeching, some howling and yelling as though the spirit hurt them very much and smote their fists and stamped their feet and some pounded the benches with their fists.  The preacher's name is West and they threw out many slurs but no proof.

29th [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles and Luther's priest did not meet me for he had been there and told Brother Cassleman [Casselman] that he wanted to withdraw the appointment.  So I preached on the 60th chapter [of] Isaiah.  

30th [January, 1840].  Traveled three miles to Brother William Empey's.  Preached in the evening on Revelation 22:14.  Had a very good time and many believing.  Traveled in all up to the 30th January, 1840, 2,593 miles.

31st [January, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Mr. John Hickey's where I met Mr. Nankerville, a Methodist preacher, to hold a debate and almost the whole county gathered to hear, for he had agreed to prove the Book of Covenants false.  We had regular order, only the chairman, a Mr. Michael Empy, cheated me out of some considerable time.  But our debate lasted about six hours in a very [page 29] good humor, only he made use of foul expressions without proof, such as it is from beneath and imposture.  But he referred to from 25 to 30 pages of the Covenants, yet strange to say not one passage of scripture to the point brought forward to prove the book false or any part of it, and finally it was a jumbled up mess and all he advanced was darkness.  And while I brought forward the Methodist's discipline on several points of it, the groans, the ..., the cries from the Methodists were beyond description and the spirit by which they were activated is only known by the power of light and I find it is hard for any of the paid priests to stand against the truth of God.  But in their ... they try to uphold their craft, for by it they get their gain.  And before I left them, I told them that the hour of God's judgments had come and I ... them to repent, both priest and people, for the day was nigh when their young men should be slain [page 30] in battle and their old men be driven from house to house and fall to rise no more, and their young women be led into captivity and many such desolations are coming on the Gentiles.  And so we closed our debate and went to Brother Cassleman's [Casselman].

Visited on Saturday, the 1st February, [1840].

2nd [February, 1840].  Preached at 11 o'clock from Revelation 6:1, after which four arose and said they would be baptized.  Adjourned until evening and a large number gathered and I felt like preach[ing], although no appointment had been given out, but came to see them baptized.  I preached about two hours from Genesis 6:16-19, after which I baptized David and Catherine Wood and Benjamin Wood and David Levi Empy [Empey] and his wife, Margaret Polly Empy.  And we gathered again in the house and confirmed them by the laying on of hands, after which I nominated a clerk, Brother John Morris, and the members sanctioned it.  I then gave them some considerable instruction [page 31] relative to their meetings, which was agreed on two times a week and through the whole, we had much of the spirit and a fine time.  And they now number fourteen and I took my leave of them recommending them to the grace of God.

3rd [February, 1840].  Started to Father's about 88 miles and Brother John Morison brought me about 20 miles in a sleigh and left Brother Mercley [Merkley] at his father's.  I stayed at Prescott [Ontario, Canada] all night.

4th [February, 1840].  Traveled to the Widow Mott's.  She is a believing.  I also called at Brockville [Ontario, Canada] and got a part of the hymnbooks that I had agreed with Mr. Buell, for he printed 500 for $20 and 20 hymns each.  I was led to this because I had not hymnbooks of our own.  And many were poor and could not well afford to purchase a large one, and I thought the poor had as good a right to sing as the rich.

5th [February, 1840].  Traveled to Brother Hiram Mott's, and here I understand some that believed and had they done their duty [page 32] would have been baptized have since been very sorry that they had not complied.

6th [February, 1840].  Traveled to Father's, 3 1/2 miles above Perth [Ontario, Canada].  Found all well.

7th [February, 1840].  Traveled two miles to Brother Mott's, found them well and had a good visit.

8th [February, 1840].  Traveled two miles to Father's and I am now waiting for a letter from my wife that has been sent to Kempville [Kemptville, Ontario, Canada]; and also resting for a few days, for I have tired myself almost out preaching and traveling.

Sunday, 9th [February, 1840].  Begin to feel rested some, and want to know what my best course is to do the most good and help roll forth the kingdom.

10th [February, 1840].  Visited.

11th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles and still visiting and waiting.

12th [February, 1840].  Traveled sixteen miles to Brother Nichols.

13th [February, 1840].  Traveled fourteen miles to Canthon Place [Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada], feeling impressed to try to find a place to preach.  And this is the second time that I have tried to preach here, but all in vain.  Stayed all night at Mr. Hugh Bolton's.  His wife and wife's daughter are very kind, and if they had a place large enough I could have it.  But meetinghouses, schoolhouses and all [page 33] closed up, and after conversing with some of them on the 14th [February, 1840], took my leave of them, believing their prejudice so great that I cannot get a hearing and traveled thirteen miles to Brother Nichols.

15th [February, 1840].  Traveled fifteen miles to Perth [Ontario, Canada].  Find no letter and from there to Father's.  Stayed all night.

Sunday, 16th [February, 1840].  Met the little branch.  Brother Bottone Brough was there.  We had a good time.  Traveled five miles.

17th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Perth [Ontario, Canada], received a letter from my wife.  All well.

18th [February, 1840].  Traveled fifteen miles to Brother H. [Hiram] Mott's and my wife wishes me to come home as soon as navigation opens and I ... to comply.

19th [February, 1840].  Traveled 27 miles through Brockville [Ontario, Canada].  Stayed at John McEathron's [McEathanon].

20th [February, 1840].  Traveled twelve miles to Prescott [Ontario, Canada] and there I find Brother Hiram Mott and I preached there in the evening in a small place.  The meetinghouse is closed against me as I understood.

21st [February, 1840].  Traveled about eight miles to Ogdensburg [Lawrence, New York] and back to Prescott [Ontario, Canada].  Sent a letter to my wife while in Ogdensburg.  Preached in Prescott in the evening on the first principles at William Bancraft's, but many of them acted as if the withs begin to ... [page 34], for they talked and swore and left the room and some of them stole the key out of the door and my ... broke the ... which rolled ... against the door and locked the door and there was no order.  I concluded that if they would not keep order they should do their own preaching and I left them.

Traveled nine miles on the 22nd [February, 1840] to the S. White's and on my way, visited a Mr. Rude, and I found wife to know much about the Old Testament and she believed the doctrine of Christ on as much as I told her and they wished me to preach there.

23rd [February, 1840], Sunday.  Stayed all day at Mr. White's.  They are very kind and partly believing.  It is a hard time, for it rains ... and it is very muddy and my boots leak and my mind is uneasy about my family and it a hard case, but I must finish my mission.

24th [February, 1840].  Traveled eighteen miles to friend Halley's.  Found two the sisters, Halleys, well and in faith and others believing.

[page 35] 25th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Wilcox's and Smith's.  All well.  Gave out an appointment and preached in the evening to the Church and a few others on the gathering.  They appear to be doing well and trying as well.

26th [February, 1840].  Traveled 26 miles out to the river and down to Brother Casselman's [Cassleman].  This is where I had baptized eleven before and found they were to have a meeting at Brother William Empey's that evening and traveled four miles to it and preached to them, and many others came to hear preaching on gathering.

27th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Casselman's [Cassleman].  Preached on the Book of Mormon in the evening to a large assembly, after which I baptized Brother Thomas Lang and his wife, Mary Lang, and his daughter, Nancy Lang, and Brother Kinsey and his wife, Margaret Morgan, after which I confirmed them and we had a very good time and gave out a meeting for two weeks for a conference at Brother Casselman's.

28th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles.  Preached in the evening at Brother Woods' on Revelation 22:15 to a large congregation.

29th [February, 1840].  Traveled four miles and preached at a Mr. Hoophole's schoolhouse at the place where I had the [page 36] debate with Mr. Lile.  They gave good attention and I think good will be done here.  Traveled four miles back to Brother Lang's, stayed all night.   Him and his family are very kind and intelligent and the spirit appears to intimate that Brother Lang must come to the priesthood and will be good in council and a useful man.

Sunday, 1st March [1840].  Traveled four miles to Brother Casselman's [Cassleman].  Preached at 2 o'clock to a large assembly and many convinced and the work rolling on, thanks be to the Lord.  Traveled in all up to this date, since I left Quincy on my mission, 2,902 miles.

2nd [March, 1840].  Traveled one mile, stayed at Michael Hickey's.  They are partly believing.

3rd [March, 1840].  Traveled one mile.  Arrived Brother Kinsey's, Morgan's, and Mr. White's, and on the 4th [March, 1840], traveled one mile to Jacob Camons.  I find that many mobs are threatening in this region and the newspapers team with falsehood and abuse against the work of God.  Stayed all night at Brother William Empey's.

5th [March, 1840].  Traveled three miles.  Visited Thomas Amon's, found them [page 37] believing and said she would be baptized but waiting for her husband.  Traveled to Brother D. [David] Woods', preached on Isaiah 41:15.

6th [March, 1840].  Traveled to Brother William Empey's and baptized William Thomas Lang, a son of Brother Lang baptized before.  Traveled in all five miles, stayed all night at Brother Levy Empey's [Levi Empy].  Several came in.  We had an interesting time.

7th [March, 1840].  Traveled five miles, preached in the schoolhouse where Mr. Lile met me.  A peaceable congregation, preached on the coming of Christ.  Here it was said Mr. Lile would meet me again and I said let him come if he pleases and it is said that he boasted that he would meet me at every place where I would preach.  But he has failed several times.  And the neighbors here say that I am the slickest blagguard [braggart] in this part and I suppose Mr. Lile fears that his doctrine and his drunkenness will be exposed, for his system is a system of idolatry.

I then got hold of what strength I could from the Lord and spoke awhile on the literal fulfillment of the prophecy, after which Mr. Pike arose and addressed the congregation and told some falsehoods and many misrepresentations and among the rest, the Spaulding story.  And while I replied to him, he and some others, if not priests, wishes to be I should think, made a disturbance and the evil spirit in them showed itself for it was not a drunk spirit.  We continued until near 12 [o'clock], it being in the evening.  However, it drew the necessary division and many wished to hear me through.  Went home with James Felt, the Episcopal leader.

[page 1] The class leader and his wife are very friendly and it appears like a home to me.  And a Doctor Candell that came from Prescott to hear me and is believing stayed with me all night and advised me to take an emetic in the morning.  The 4th of April, [1840], he gave me one and I feel better, although I am still weak.

5th [April, 1840], Sunday.  Preached at 4 o'clock p.m. on the priesthood to a large congregation and many appear to believe.  But the Methodists have the schoolhouse and they are afraid that their craft is in danger and think it best to nip it in the bud and just not give me the house to preach in again.  And their class leader, Mr. Felt, and his wife are still friendly but seek action [page 2] against me.  And I leave and now feel that their love of the world will prevent them from embracing the truth.  And I think that many are believing in this place, but most of them have their affections placed on the world and their minds are darkened by the deceitfulness of this world and seem to act as if this world is their God.  Thus it appears that they fear the Lord by the precepts of men and their graven images and some of them bow before the Lord and I think receive some of His spirit.  But the spirit of the world is upon them, I think at least ten times where the Spirit of the Lord is once.  Thus they are dark and alas for them, for their destruction is nigh at hand and their overthrow is sure.  Thus I leave them.

6th [April, 1840].  Traveled three miles and visited many and told them to prepare for the coming of the Son of God.

7th [April, 1840].  Sent a letter home and one to the Osnabrood Branch and traveled 12 miles to John McEathron's.

8th [April, 1840].  Traveled 15 miles to the Widow Mott's and while in this section, I heard much talk of war and it is expected that Great Britain and China are hard at it and that the Russians will help China and the States and England will soon be at war and so the world is in commotion and Great Babylon will soon come into remembrance before the Lord to reward her for all her abominations and fornications.  [page 3] Roll on thy purposes, O Lord, and let thy saints be glad and shout for joy and give them grace for all the tribulations through which the saints have to pass and give judgment unto the saints and restore the kingdom to its real, O Lord.

9th [April, 1840].  Traveled 12 miles to Hiram Mott's and on my way visited Brother [Joseph] Coad and gave out an appointment for the 10th.  Traveled three miles, preached on the priesthood to a few.  Stayed overnight at Brother Plunket's.

11th [April, 1840].  And baptized Mary Coad, wife of J. C. [Joseph Coad], and Joseph Coad, his son.  And Jane Duck, the convert of J. D. and Laneih Plunkett, the wife of R. P. [Plunkett], after which we returned to the house of Brother Coad and I confirmed them members in the Church of Christ.

We had a fire in the woods by the side of the creek where we baptized and were very comfortable and secluded from the world.  Sister Duck was confined to her bed with a fine daughter about 15 hours after she was baptized and she thinks she received no injury and is doing well and the child, and her faith is strong and is well pleased that she was baptized.

Sunday, 12th [April, 1840].  Preached at Dock's at 11 o'clock on the gathering, after which bid them farewell and traveled three miles to Brother Mott's.

13th [April, 1840].  Traveled to Perth [Ontario, Canada], 15 miles there.  I feel that I have filled my mission nearly at this time and I have baptized 33 in this section and witnessed the baptism of many more and have traveled in all since 12th of July, last, about [page 4] 3,000 miles and now begin to make ready to return home to my family, and continued to make ready until the 6th May, [1840], and then bid my father's household farewell and started home.  Traveled 17 miles to Brother Hiram Mott's, Brother John Nichol with me.

10th [May, 1840], Sunday.  Went to hear a Mr. Burwell and Evningite preach and one of the elders arose and spoke a few minutes, during which he said that the forerunner of Christ, which was John, was to prepare the way for Christ and that ministry was Elias and that Elijah must come again to prepare the way for the second coming.  And Mr. Burwell cried out with a remarkable strange and loud voice; said he had come and it appeared to me that the house was filled with evil spirits and [page 5] although Elijah has come, yet I think that the spirit by which he spoke was an evil one for it brought darkness and fear instead of light and love on the glory of the Only Begotten.  And during the time Mr. B. [Burwell] was preaching, many strong, invective ... thrown upon them that came into this country, Canada, a land of royalty, and stole away the people and took them into a land of lawlessness and led them into the wilderness to give all their prophets to their idol.  They had let up and argued strangely that if we should give away all at once, if the Lord should call for a tithe on a sacrifice, we would have nothing to give.  I think strange logic and stated that it was the devil speaking through them and the Lord would blast it and it would come to naught, for it was the work of the devil.  He said their main child is Christ and the church.

11 [May, 1840].  Went on board ""Commodore Berry"" steamer at 9 o'clock in the evening.  We started for Toronto, $4 for each horse, $2 for wagon, and $2 [page 6] for myself.  Landed in Toronto on the 12th at 8 o'clock in the evening and traveled eight miles to the Hunter.

5th [June, 1840].  Traveled 40 miles, traveling four miles east of Quincy.

Found my family well and doing as well as I could expect, being absent from them near eleven months.  And I now commence farming and attending to my business at home.  Nothing of note happened for some time, although I found on my arrival that several of the Twelve had gone to England and doing well, and Elders Hyde and Page had gone to Jerusalem.  After being at home some time and hearing several debates with the great Dr. Nelson and visiting the brethren at Commerce and preached once in Quincy [page 8] on the priesthood.

My family was taken sick and Sidney Moses, the babe, and George, after a severe dysentery of the worst kind, they both fell asleep, the first on Friday, the 7th of August, [1840], and the latter on Sunday, the 9th of August, 1840.  Thus two of my sons are gone and it appears strange, but they have gone from the tribulations of the last days and the rest are not in good health.  Thus, my family is reduced to five in all, two sons and one girl.  Wife and self and many of the brethren are sick and some have died lately, and how great our tribulations will be, I know not, but the Lord's will be done.

About this time, the baptism ... this is about four miles from Quincy, Adams County, Illinois, and here I continued about the 27th of March and my lease is near out, and a Mr. John Powel, from whom I had the lease, became my enemy and prosecuted me for cutting firewood on the land I had leased, and he expected to obtain one hundred dollars from me and the prejudice was high against me, but I pled my case.  And between him and the lawyer up high and caused a great [page 9] court and eight hits on me and I paid it.

And I now start for Nauvoo and arrived there about the 1st of March, 1841.  Here I began to build a house, and about the 5th of August, moved into it, and on the 6th [August, 1841], visited a conference where we had much teaching and all in order.

I immediately purchased a piece of land over the river in the Iowa and fenced it and I also purchased three lots in the city from William Hiliam and I commenced work for the Law and Fosters Stone.

Worked in the winter and then built a cabin on Madison Island and moved onto it for the winter.  Hunted out a larger lot of timber and moved back to the city about the 1st of April, 1842, and commenced building a house for myself on one of my lots.  Moved into it sometime in the summer.

During the summer a ... persecution from Missouri troubled us very much and about this time I sold my place over the river to Hiram Mott, and thus my time was taken up in labor buying and selling.  And about this time, I joined the Freemasons. [End of book #3.]

16 [March, 1843].  Traveled eight miles to Newport and preached to a large concourse, for the Methodists appear to gather all their strength to crush me.  But their shame was manifest to all but bigots and their preachers, Mr. Nobles and Russell and Dones.  Their preachers disputed with me and raised their opposition to the word of God to uphold their craft.  Thus, the Lord judge between me and them.

	PIONEER OF AMERICAN FORK, UTAH
	1852

	Source:  Biographical sketch of Lydia Thornton Adams by Cynthia Adams Okey, microfilm of typescript, BYU.

	Lydia Thornton Adams is the daughter of Oliver and Mary Griswald Thornton, born 19 October 1830, at Pickering, Ontario County, Canada.  She was the oldest of twelve children and proud of the fact of being born the year the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was organized.

	Her parents were earnest seekers of religious truth and were much confused at the cry of the many churches of their time of ""Come join us for Here is the way, low here is the way' to receive Christ and be saved.""  Seven years after the organization of the Church, her parents accepted the gospel as taught to them by the missionaries traveling in Canada.  Aunt Lydia was ten years old when she was baptized.

	Early in the spring of 1828, the Thornton family decided to move to the head quarters of the Church at Kirkland, Ohio.  They were bundled into a big sleigh with a fine team of horses and crossed the Great Lakes on the ice.  Arriving in the United States they proceeded direct to Kirtland, Ohio; remaining there three months, they joined the movement westward and went with the Saints to Far West, Missouri.

	In February, 1839, they were driven by mob persecution to leave Missouri and they moved to Bear Creek, near Fairfield, Adams County, Illinois. From here they moved to Hancock County Illinois, and settled on a farm near Carthage.  It was owned by a man named David R. Fales.  They were living here when the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were martyred, 5:30 o'clock, June 27, 1844, by an armed mob with blackened faces.  They heard the gun fire and felt the sad oppression that hung over the country side but did not know what had happened until midnight when the wife of George D. Grant came to their home and told them the Prophet had been killed.

	The Grants lived on a neighboring farm and Mrs. Grant filled with fear had waited until darkness came, then she took her baby and another little one in her arms and went to tell the sad news to the Thornton family.  Brother Grant had gone to Nauvoo to tell the sad news to the Saints there.

	Aunt Lydia's parents took her and their other children to see those great leaders as they lay in state in the Nauvoo Mansion.  These two noble men with their pallid faces, hallowed looking even in death was an incident in her life she never forgot.

	They later moved to Nauvoo and in the spring of 1846, they left Nauvoo with the Saints and went to Iowa.  It was at about this time, Aunt Lydia was married to Edmond Buttler, being about sixteen years of age.

	They remained in Iowa two years, then moved into Lynn County, Missouri, hoping here to find peace and rest from persecutions of mobs and wicked men.  But not so, they were soon forced to move on, this time going 150 miles west settling along the Des Moines River.  Here they engaged in farming and freighting for two years and managed to get two wagons and two good teams of horses, and struggled on to Kanesville, near Council Bluffs, Iowa.

	They stayed here until the spring of 1852, when their one ambition was realized; they were able to go on to Great Salt Lake and join the main body of the Church.  They arrived in Salt Lake City in the fall of 1852.  Brigham Young sent the family to American Fork.  They took up land and built a house where the old Thornton home now stands, east of town.

	Aunt Lydia's mother had six children during the fourteen years they were traveling from Canada to Utah.  Aunt Lydia was with them during all this traveling, persecutions and trying times.  Being the oldest of the children it fell her lot to take a large share of the responsibilities of her mother's burdens.  She also had married, had three children and lost them all and was a widow before she was twenty-two years old.

	Imagine, or think if you can going through such tragic experiences for one so young.  What faith, courage and determination she must have had.  Through trials and sorrow, hunger and persecution she went coming out each time like pure gold tested seven times in a furnace of white heat.  Can we appreciate our pioneer mothers enough, their value, their integrity, their sacrifice for that what they knew to be true.

	The Thornton home in American Fork was cross the road from where Joshua Adams owned land.  While working here, no doubt is how he met, wooed and won Lydia Thornton, for his bride.  For in two years after their arrival here she became the first wife of Joshua Adams.  Being married in 1814, in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City.

	In 1857, the first I remember is that she lived on the north east corner of second north and first west streets, in the big brick house, now owned by Phebe Lynch.  It was here most of all her ten children were born.

	Years later father moved my mother (Mary Hoggard Adams) from the house beside the state road, about one block and a half north and built Aunt Lydia the two story brick home, on the site where we had been living.  This home is now owned and occupied by James T. Larabry.  (1934)

	She proved herself a worthy Latter Day Saint, a tried and true pioneer, a faithful and loving wife, a devoted and affectionate mother.  Her husband was her ideal of manly and saintly perfection.  Her home, her kingdom and her children her life's ambition.  She sought no public duty and to the public she was very quiet and retiring.  But her life was full of good queenly principles worthy of emulation by her numerous posterity.

	She died in American Fork, Utah County, Utah, April 30, 1901.  Being the mother of ten children, Joshua; Lydia Ann; Amos F.; Thomas Ephraim; Alice Melissia; Sabina Clark; Charity Melissia; Joseph Steven; Emeretta and Oliver Marion.  Three of this family are still living at this writing, November 29, 1934, 16 living grand children, 10 dead, 26 living great grand children, 3 dead, and 1 living great, great grand child, making a total of 56 descendants of this noble woman.

Our Pioneer Parents

Oh if I had the words and the power
And could put them into rhyme,
I would write them down on paper
Of your dear parents and mine.

I would tell you of their sorrows,
Of their trials and their joys,
Their anticipation of the morrow --
Gave them courage without alloy.

Did they stand those trials for nothing
With no hope of any reward?
They gladly helped their neighbors
They had faith in a Living God.

Now let us their children
Strive to make our lives sublime,
That they will be glad to welcome us
To live with them all time.

By Rachel Helen Packer
",,,,,,1,,0,,0,0,NULL,0,,,NULL,0,0,"Martha Diana Case was born 8 October 1823 in Troy, Bradford, Co., Pennsylvania, the daughter of Moses and Rachel Purdy Case.  Being of a weak and frail constitution, she was not able to do hard labor; so most of her time was occupied in study, which gave her a fair education.  At the age of fifteen, she began to teach the “District School” in the summer months, and would attend school in the winter months herself.

In her eighteenth year she became acquainted with a gentleman by the name of Henry Howland.  As they became better acquainted, their friendship grew to love.  They were married 27 December 1842, at Flagg, Ogle County, Illinois.  They obtained a quarter section of land, and through their industry and economy made themselves a good home.  They had four children.  The eldest was a son, named Henry, born 14 January 1843, but he only lived to be five years old.  Their other three children were daughters.  The oldest was Helen Rachel, born 26 April 1846; then Emma Jane, born 14 January 1849; and then Martha, born 18 December 1851.

While living in Illinois, they became acquainted with a lady advanced in her years, by the name of Leonard; she belonged to a different kind of religion than they did.  It aroused their curiosity, and she would lend them her church books with the promise that they would take good care of them, for she prized them highly.  One of these books was the Book of Mormon.  Martha would read the book in the daytime; and when her husband came from work, she would read it over again to him.  They began to contemplate in their own minds if it might be true.  They soon began to converse about such a thing being possible.

The more they thought and talked about the subject, the more they were convinced that the Church was true.  They invited the Leonard lady to come to learn more of the religion and her faith.  By this visit they thought they could learn more of the religion and her faith.  They became so attached to her that they soon affectionately called her Grandma Leonard.

Martha thought the gospel was all plain and true.  She was anxious to see her father and mother, brothers and sisters, to explain the gospel to them that they might know of the true gospel, and not wander in the darkness any longer.  It was not long before she and her husband started out to make her parents a visit and make them acquainted with their new faith.  But how disappointed they were, as not one could see as they did; and they even thought poor Martha D. with her bad health had gone crazy.  How sad Martha felt to think her folks could not be made to see and believe as she did; but her faith was not shaken.

It was not long before the spirit of gathering with the Saints became foremost in their minds.  It was a long, tedious journey to make to Utah with a team and a wagon, especially with Martha having poor health.  They would often wonder and talk the matter over among them selves and ask each other if it were wise and prudent to make such a journey.  Martha being of a courageous disposition believed they should try to make the journey, so they began making preparations.  They bought $10.00 worth of medicine and all the comforts they could think of for the journey.  Henry could find no one able to buy his property, so he rented it on a five-year lease to his father-in-law, Moses Case.

In the year 1852, Henry, his wife, his three daughters, and Grandma Leonard left their home in Illinois to join with the Latter-day Saints in the Valley of the Rocky Mountains.  They came to the Missouri River, and there they met a company of Latter-day Saints who were making preparations to go to Salt Lake City.  While waiting for the company to get ready to start, he took his blacksmith tools and helped the men fix their wagons and other implements to get ready to start.  In the forepart of June, everything was ready and they started their journey again.  Henry worked very hard to help the Saints cross the Missouri.  The cholera broke out in their company. And there were many lives lost.  Among those who died, Martha lost her dear and kind husband on 15 June 1852; now she was left among strangers, which she had only seen a few days, with the exception of her three daughters, the eldest being six years old, and Grandma Leonard.  Due to the dreaded disease, Captain John Tidwell thought it best for her to get in a wagon with someone else with her children, so it would not spread to the rest of the family.  Grandma Leonard would not comply with the wish and said that she wanted to stay with Henry’s body.  Through the excitement, the team was not harnessed properly; and the team ran away with the corpse and Grandma Leonard.  She was thrown out of the wagon and killed instantly.  They were both buried in the same grave on the banks of the Missouri River.

It was several hours before Martha was aware of the sad accident, as she had fainted as the team ran away.  These were indeed sad days for her, but many friends helped her and cheered her up through her troubles.  She still had her desire to go to Utah, and she was baptized 20 June 1852 by John Tidwell in the first water they came to.  She stood the journey very well.  Peter Preece, and she arrived in Salt Lake City with the company of Saints.

She bought a house and a lot in the Second Ward in Salt Lake City and lived there until 1855.  In 1853 she married Telamchus Rogers, but it was not a happy union, and they lived together for about a year and then separated being advised to do so by the General Authorities.  She had one daughter born to her through this union, Henrietta Louisa Rogers, born 31 July 1854.  Martha D. being a generous disposition was always ready to divide with the poor and needy.  While she was a widow, she took a poor old blind woman and kept her a year.  She always fed the hungry and never turned them from her door.

During the grasshopper siege of 1854, she shared her last loaf of bread with a poor beggar woman, and she did not know where the next mouthful would come from.  But she was blessed by the Lord for her generosity, for before the nightfall a gentleman by the name of Tanner brought her 200 pounds of flour which carried her through until harvest.

She taught school in her home in Salt Lake City.  While teaching, she became acquainted with William A. Hickman, who at that time was well thought of in the Church, but much later apostatized. Martha married him in 1855, being his ninth wife, for she believed in the Celestial order of marriage.  During this marriage she had four children, Jordan R., Avilda Diana, Don Carlos, and Mary Rosetts.

During the year 1858, her home in Salt Lake City was sold, and she moved to West Jordan and made her home there for a few years.  At the time of Johnson’s Army, she moved to the southern part of Utah and taught school under a large tree at the Pond home.  When the Saints moved back to Salt Lake, she also came back to her home in the city.

In the year 1860, her eldest daughter married Nephi Packer, and they moved to Brigham City.  In 1861 Martha went to visit her daughter during the summer.  She remained in West Jordan until 1863 and then she moved to Franklin, Idaho.  She taught school in Franklin for several years.  She was well known for the beautiful fancy work she could do with her sewing.  She bought a piece of land in Franklin and had a house erected.  Her second daughter, Emma Jane, married Nephi Comish; and Martha, her daughter, married Isaac B. Nash, and they made their homes in Franklin.  

She taught true and everlasting principles to her children and all she came in contact with.  At the present time, 15 February 1895, she has 76 members in her posterity.  She died in full fellowship of the Gospel on 16 March 1872, in Franklin, Oneida County, Idaho.

The temple records indicate that she was sealed to all three husbands.  Joseph Fielding Smith wrote a daughter answering this problem that such problems as this one will be worked during the Millennium. The children of all three marriages wanted to and were sealed to Henry Howland.

10,histories,1165963861,,,,"Biography of Sophronia Phylinda Clark by Vida Page Conway",,,,,,1,,0,,0,0,NULL,0,,,NULL,0,0,"Great grandmother Sophronia Phylinda Clark, daughter of Joseph Clark and Phylinda Carpenter, was born July 14, 1829 in Villanovia, Chautaqua County, New York.

Her parents joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in their native state New York and came to Utah in 1851, settling in Pleasant Grove, Utah.  They built a home on the ground where the Grove Theatre now is located on Main Street.

Her mother did not live very long after they came here.  She sickened, died and was buried in the Pleasant Grove Cemetery Jan. 7, 1853.  She was the first white woman buried in that cemetery.  Her father died Oct. 25, 1866 and was buried beside his loving and devoted wife.

Sometime after they came to Pleasant Grove her mother purchased a new tin wash pan which was placed at the front of the house near the door on a homemade bench.  There was also a water pail and a soap dish on this bench.  They were so proud of the shiny new wash pan for it had been a long time since they had owned a new one.  One morning an old Indian squaw came to their door.   She saw the shiny new pan, it took her fancy and she wanted it.  Sophronia grabbed it from her and ran into the house.  Her mother heard the noise and happened to look up – into a small mirror they had.  She saw the Indian unsheathe a long knife and raise it to strike her.  She slammed the door just in the nick of time to save her daughter’s life, for the knife was plunged into the door instead of Sophronia’s back.

Sophronia had a very brilliant mind and was indeed blessed with a wonderful memory.  She received her education in the public schools of New York.  (I have been told that Sophronia was a school teacher.)

The first school house was begun in September 1852 and was completed about Thanksgiving time.  It was built by the townspeople and adobes were used in its construction.  A dirt roof covered the structure.  The roof was made with poles, a layer of willows and finally covered with sod and dirt.  Though not very sightly, it was comfortable and rather commodious.  A fireplace at the west end of the structure with pitch-pine wood used for fuel helped to keep it cozy during the winter months.  The building was also used as a public meeting place. 

In the beginning the studies were limited to reading, spelling, writing, arithmetic, geography and grammar, spelling being the hobby.  Friday afternoons were given to “spelling matches.”  The students used quills for pens.  The teacher kept a sharp knife handy so that the quills could be kept sharp and ready for use.  Ink had to be made from oak-bark boiled with copperas.  Paper was very scarce so writing was mostly done on slates.  Slate pencils were whittled from slate rock, some of which was found in a hill near the mouth of Battle Creek Canyon.

Sophronia had a wonderful knowledge of geography.  Every time she heard the name of a river, city, lake or country, she could not rest until she could look it up on the map.  The same was true when she heard a new word.  She always kept a dictionary handy so she could learn its meaning, spelling and pronunciation. 
 
She enjoyed listening to her children, and later on her grandchildren, spell and do their home work.  She would drill them till they knew their lessons by heart.  School work was a must with her and it was done on time and done well.  There was no half way  measures with her.  Everything she and her family did was done to the best of their ability, or it was done over again.

She also played games with them in the evening after their work was finished.  They played the game of “fox and geese” more than any other game.  This game was played with buttons.  They also played “Man of Moris {or Mars}” and other games.  All of her grandchildren loved her dearly.

My mother, Eva Cordelia Thorne, and her cousin, Dora Mayhew, stayed with their grandmother a great deal of the time.  They took turns sleeping next to her.  This was one of the high lights of their young lives.  She called Eva her “brown sugar” for she had dark brown eyes and dark brown hair, and Dora she called her “white sugar” for her yes were blue and her hair was blonde.

She had a small stand with drawers on either side of it.  She would pull this stand up near the stove for them to eat their breakfast on.  They would pull out the drawer, turn it upside down and put their plates on it.  Her knives and forks had black handles and her teaspoons were silver.

Henson Walker Jr. and Sophronia Clark were married 7 June 1852 at the Endowment House in Salt Lake City, Utah. 

Soon after coming to Pleasant Grove, Sophronia was courted by a handsome young man named Henson Walker Jr.  Soon thereafter they drove to Salt Lake and were married in the Endowment House June 7, 1852.  She became Henson’s third wife.  On the way home from being married, they had a quarrel and they didn’t live together for a short time.  This, however, was soon patched up and they were very happy for quite some time.

On account of Henson having three other wives and children, it was necessary for her to help out in every way she could.  She made some of her living by gleaning wheat in the fall of the year.  Part of the grain was made into flour for baking and the other part was used to feed her chickens.  She also shucked corn.  She gathered fruit from the hills which she preserved or dried.  She used molasses, honey or sorghum for her sweetening as there wasn’t any sugar in those early days.
 	
She had a small plot of ground around her home where she raised her vegetables.  She also planted fruit trees.  This helped out considerably when the trees began to bear fruit.  The sweet apples she raised were delicious and all of the neighborhood children along with her own grandchildren enjoyed eating them.  The greening apples she raised made such delicious pies and apple sauce.  She also had an apricot tree and wild native current bushes and Pottawatomie plum trees grew along the fence.  She also had gooseberry bushes and raspberry canes.  The Holman family lived next door to the east and Lydia Brown family lived on the north.

Sophronia’s little one-roomed home stood on the ground where the Latter Day Saint’s Seminary building now stands.  It was there that her four children were born.  Martha Jane, the eldest, was born May 18, 1853 and Cordelia Phylinda, my grandmother, was born Sept. 29 1855.  Her other two daughters Mary Medora born Oct 10, 1858 – died Mar. 22, 1864; Susan Marie was born Oct. 20, 1860 and died Oct, 28,1860.  These deaths were a great sorrow to Sophronia for she loved children.  There were no hospitals or doctors in those days.  The mothers all had their children at home attended by some good friend or neighbor or a mid-wife.  After each death she was grief stricken but she had to pick up the threads of life and go on.  She was certain she would see these little souls again and this knowledge gave her the courage to live on for the ones who needed her here.

With all of her family duties to keep her busy she always found time to work in the Church.  She worked Relief Society, taught in Sunday School, and being gifted with a wonderful voice, she sang in the choir and also helped with the singing in the other organizations.  She composed poetry and was often called upon to read.  Only one of her many poems was preserved and we feel it is a great loss to her family for we would have loved to have had them all now.  

She raised her children in the light of the gospel.  They were taught to trust in God, to live righteous lives and always be grateful for their many blessings.  She made and furnished all of the sacrament bread used in the ward for years.

She was a beautiful seamstress, making all of her own and her daughter’s clothing, besides sewing for others to help increase her small income.  She made her own garments and corset covers for Sunday wear, also her petticoats with ruffles on them.  These items were made of unbleached factory or as we call it now, unbleached muslin.  She wet this and hung it on the line to bleach in the sun.  It took quite sometime to get it as white as snow.  She made her sheets and pillow cases and bleached them also.  Sometimes the material was wet and laid on the grass to bleach.  She made her aprons out of black and white, red and white, blue and white – small checked calico.  Dresses were made of bright calico prints with round collars and wrist length sleeves.  She fashioned her best dressed out of cashmere.  She also knitted sox and sold them.  Such was Sophronia’s thriftiness and ambition.  She was very independent and never asked anyone to do anything for her that she could do for herself.

She took great pride and satisfaction in patch work quilts and she designed her own patterns, doing fancy quilting of birds, flowers, baskets and many other intricate designs.  Her stitches were small and even for she was a beautiful quilter.  She cut out such small pieces to sew into blocks she could scarcely hold them to sew them together.  She was the envy of most every woman in Pleasant Grove in her sewing and quilting.  She did every stitch by hand for she never owned a sewing machine.  

I (Vida) must have inherited some of her traits for I love to do all of these things that she did, such as quilting and all kinds of arts and crafts and also try to write poetry and I love to read.  I have often heard it said that our ancestors leave their marks on their posterity and I believe that is so.

She was a very neat and dressy person and her home was kept as clean and as immaculate as she was.  She never left a dish standing.  After each meal the dishes had to be washed.  My own mother was just like her, or like her in these things which I have mentioned.  She heated all of her water on top of the kitchen stove.  Her stove was all black and had four holes on top and an open grate in front with a hearth where a person could sit and toast their feet if and when they were cold.  Many times the children would sit and watch the fire burning in this grate while they sat eating popcorn or munching on apples or other fruit.

Her one room held all of her earthly belongings.  She had a home-made was stand near the back door that held her water bucket, was basin and soap dish.  She carried all of her water for washing and cleaning from a ditch that was in front of her home.  She had a board with a trough made so she could set her bucket down in the ditch and it would fill without dipping it in the ditch and make it muddy.  This water most generally ran clear.  She carried her drinking water from her neighbor’s well.  She had a wash-board and a round tub which was used for washing and also for their bathing.  She made all of her own soap.  She heated her sad irons on the stove to do her ironing.  Such was the general pattern of house work of our Pioneer women in those early days.

Part of her floor was covered with home-made carpet.  She would put a layer of fresh straw on the floor, then stretch and tack the carpet over it.  When house-cleaning time came, the carpet was taken up, beaten and shaken until every particle of dust was out of it.  Sometimes the carpet strips were unpicked and washed, then sewed together again before stretching and tacking into place.  The old straw was gathered up and burned and new fresh straw was put on the floor again.  The rest of her floor was just plain boards but were scrubbed with home-made soap till they were white.  Her bed was in the northwest corner and her springs were made of rope stretched tight.  Many and many a time she had her grandson, David B. Thorne jump on the ropes while she tightened them.  She had a straw tick that was filled to overflowing at threshing time.  On top of this was placed a feather tick filled with feathers she had plucked from her chickens.  Her pillows were also made from chicken feathers.  Sometimes people were fortunate to have duck down in their pillows and feather beds.  No wonder her children and grandchildren loved to sleep with her for her bed was fit for a king’s rest with the clean sheets, pillow cases and lovely quilted quilts.

She had a homemade wardrobe to hang her clothes in and a home made cupboard for all of her lovely dishes, pots and pans, and her food.  At first her curtains were made of muslin and were taken down often and washed and ironed to perfection.  Later on, she had lace curtains and every hole was darned before they were washed, then they were stretched and hung up again.

At the back of her house was a little lean-to where she kept her fire wood neatly piled.  She chopped some of it herself.  Her son-in-laws and their boys hauled it from the nearby canyons and sawed it for her.  They always saw to it that she was well supplied with wood, cut in stove lengths and most always chopped for her.

Underneath her house was a makeshift cellar with a trap-door where she kept her fruit and vegetables for her winter’s supply.  The vegetables and apples always kept so fresh and nice.  Most generally they were as crisp in the spring as they were when they were put there in the fall.

Her coal-oil lamp was the only light she had other than candles.  No T.V., radio or telephone services were available in those days.  She was thrilled with her lamp, however, for she could ready by it and she spent many pleasant hours with her beloved books.  She did not have many, but what she did have were read many times from cover to cover for they were her friends.  She knew the scriptures well and also the characters of people long dead—through her books.

There were no matches in those days so she used to bank her fire at night so she would have live coals in the morning.  The hard wood was best for banking fires.  If her fire went out during the night, she would watch for the first sign of smoke from her neighbors chimney and she would take a bucket or a shovel and go to borrow some live coals to rekindle her own fire.

She had a cow that she took care of by herself, walking to and from the pasture, then milking her and taking care of the milk and cream.  She churned her own butter and it was so good on her home made bread, biscuits and pancakes.

Sophronia had brown hair and dark brown eyes and a beautiful nose.  Her daughter Cordelia always said she didn’t think noses were pretty but she said her mother was an exception for she really had a beautiful nose.  She was about five feet five inches tall and she was a beautiful woman.  She was a woman of exceptional modesty.  Could she see the mode of dress today and its customs, she would have been shocked to death.  She was sitting near her open kitchen door one warm summer day bathing her feet when a neighbor happened to knock.  She was so upset she told him to go away while she made herself presentable before she could see what he wanted.

Sorphronia was of a jealous nature, so having to share a husband with three other women made her very unhappy and lonesome.  She finally separated from her husband Henson.  In those days people didn’t have to secure a divorce.  She married another man but this wasn’t the solution to her problem for she didn’t even live with him and was always so sorry she had been so foolish.  Before she died she sent for Henson to come to see her.  He had a little stubborn streak in him also and he wouldn’t forgive her.  She was heart broken and she didn’t live too much longer after this.

Sophronia believed in discipline, not only for herself but for her children and grandchildren as well.  When she told a child to do something she saw to it that they did it.  She was firm but kind.  Another of her virtues was punctuality.  She, nor her children were ever late for church, school or for any other assignment.
She was thrifty to a fault, for nothing was ever wasted in her home.  She had to work too hard to get what little she had to ever waste anything.

Such were the fine qualities Sophronia possessed and she was also rich in possessions not seen nor felt – her faith in God, her testimony of His goodness to her and her family.  She had a great deal of faith in the goodness of people, especially her family, neighbors, friends and relatives.   She was ever ready to share her meagerness with anyone who was in need, and was able to give comfort and consolation to anyone bowed down in sorrow.

Her eldest daughter, Martha, was fifteen years old when she married Austin S. Mayhew who was twice her age, he being thirty.  To this union were born eleven children.

Her second daughter, Cordelia, was seventeen when she married Robert Thorne.  To this union – nine children were born.

The years flew by and they were hard years but with the love of her children and grandchildren which were her source of happiness, she met each day with faith and courage.  She knew that life could not produce any situation she could not meet and manage.  She had that rare quality – peace of mind until she became ill.  She knew why she was here on the earth.  She knew where she wanted to go when she left it and she worked toward that end.  Along with the good basic principles of living, she also left with us physical features that can be seen in her great, great grand children.  Surely this is living proof that we live on in the ones who are left.

When her health began to fail, her son-in-law, Robert Thorne, built a couple of rooms onto the south of his home in Lindon for her, so she could be near her daughter, Cordelia, so she could take care of her in her declining years.  She lived there for quite some time.  She became so frail and finally so dizzy at times she had to hold onto things in the house for fear of falling.  She was bedfast for the last two years of her life.  Grandmother placed a small table beside her bed and laid a spoon on it so she could pound on the table when she needed anything.  She became very demanding before she died and not at all like her old sweet self before she became ill.  She pounded so much and so often, she made quite an indentation in the top of that table.  Nevertheless, her daughter, Cordelia, cared for her with all of the love and affection a devoted daughter knew how to shower on her mother.  All of her grandchildren were very devoted to her, too.  Grandmother Thorne was never as well after her mother’s death.

Sophronia went through so many trails and hardships before she died that she became rather discouraged with life and was ready for death.  She passed away Sept. 30, 1900 at the age of seventy one years, for months and sixteen days.  Although she suffered much sorrow and many heart aches before her life was over, she still retained a strong testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  She knew that God lives and that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God.  She lived her religion to the best of her knowledge.

She was laid away in her beautiful temple robes and was buried in the Pleasant Grove City Cemetery, next to her father and mother and her two children.

(A biographical sketch of the life, travels, birth, and parentage of William Draper, Jr., the son of William Draper Sr. and Lydia Lathrop.)
 
My grandfather’s name was Thomas Draper and my grandmother’s maiden name was Lydia Rogers.  My father and grandfather were born in Pennsylvania State and I was born in the Providence of Upper Canada, Township of Richmond, County of Frontanact, Midland District, April 24, 1807.
	
In June 1832, for the first time I heard the Gospel preached by Elder Miller and others in company with him, and then January, 1833, I heard Brigham Young preach the same Gospel and I believed it.

This was all in the township of Longbarough, Upper Canada, and I was baptized March 20, 1833, and in June the same year I was ordained a Priest under the hands of Brigham Young, and I bore testimony and traveled and preached as circumstances permitted until September 11, 1834.  I then, in company with Daniel Wood and family, with my family (which consisted of a wife and three children) bid ado to Canada, to my birthplace, and to my father and mother, brother’s and sisters, for the sake of the Gospel and together with the saints traveled to Kirtland, Ohio which was reached the 24th day of the same month.  I was satisfied and rejoiced at the meeting some of my old friends, brethren from Canada, and more than satisfied to see the face and hear the voice of the Prophet Joseph, and from him and his brethren received much valuable instructions.

I then went to work and found location, built me a house and by hard labor provided a comfortable living for my family which consisted of a wife and three children, but I was quite poor as to the world’s goods, but I labored faithfully and prospered exceedingly and next spring, 1835 at the April conference, by a unanimous vote of the conference, the wall of the basement of the temple which had been covered the fall previous, were uncovered and the work of building the temple resumed with a covenant to finish the walls that season.  I threw in my might of labor with the rest of my brethren, which was but a few to do so great a work, but it was done.  I also went to Canada that summer on a short mission and was abundantly blessed, and returned again in safety to my family, and to the security of the Church in Kirtland.

The following winter, I had the privilege of attending the theological school, which was superintendanted by the Prophet Joseph and his councilors, which I enjoyed and from which I received much good instruction and information, and the meeting instructions preparatory to the endowment.  When the temple was finished during which time I was put into the presidency of the priest’s quorum, which the bishops presided over.

During the meetings and endowment which gave me another opportunity of forming more new and valuable acquaintances, to-wit, Bishop Edward Partridge of Zion of Missouri, and Bishop N. K. Whitney of Kirtland with their respective councilors, under who’s hands I received the ordinances and blessings which were many and great.  They being the only Bishops in the church at that time.  The twelve apostles and the first quorum of the Seventies were chosen about that time and there in the temple on the Day of Pentecost or the 6th day of April, 1836, there was such a time of the out-pouring of the Spirit of the Lord that my pen is inadequate to write it in full, or my tongue to express it.

But I will here say that the Spirit was poured out and came like a mighty rushing wind and filled the house, that many were present spoke in tongues and had visions and saw angels and prophesied, and had a general time of rejoicing, such as had not been known in this generation.

Then all things remained quiet until about the first of June.  The quorum of the twelve was sent to the eastern states and Canada to hold conference and regular affairs in the Church abroad in that direction, and I was counseled by the Prophet to go on a mission, which I did, and traveled in company with them in Longarough in Canada, which I had formerly lived and joined the church.  

We there, and in the vicinity around, held several meetings and conferences and set the branches in order and baptized quite a number of people and had a time of rejoicing together to think and to see that the Lord was blessing our labor with success.
	
But in this place we separated and the twelve continued in their mission further east down the river, St. Lawrence and crossed into the states and by that route home, but I took up on the north side of Lake Ontario, by way of Toronto, and there crossed Lake Ontario to Lewisten and by that route home, found all well and rejoicing in the blessing of the gospel.

Things went on comfortable and pleasantly during the ensuing fall and winter and by the assistance and counsel of the Prophet, I prospered exceedingly well, so that I got a nice little farm of twenty acres on which I built a good comfortable house and made other suitable improvements, suitable for the comforts of life.

All went well until some time in the summer of ’37, when travelers began to creep in which changed the state of affairs financially throughout Kirtland, which damaged me to the amount of over one thousand dollars, which took my team and other good property.

But during the ensuing winter we had a good time in the temple, and I was called upon to be ordained a high priest under the hands of Don Carlos Smith and council, who was the president of the high priest quorum and brother of the Prophet Joseph, and I was set apart to go to Illinois the coming spring to take charge and preside in the branch of the Church that had been previously raised up.

I then went to work with a main and might to make up an outfit and I succeeded in procuring a team and wagon as I intended to take my family with me, for many of the saints were making preparation to leave Kirtland in the spring and I never expected to return there any more, and I expected the avails of my little farm and home to supply me with the means to get me another home if I should ever be so happy to reach Far West where we were all aiming to go and to make a permanent home, we thought.

But let me say that I was sadly mistaken and seriously disappointed, for instead of having means to buy me another home in Far West, lo and behold, a Christian gentile had me in his clutches and swindled me out of my little home, so I never got a dime for the whole.  But he made me a liberal offer that was, if I would stay and live on the farm I should have it all my life to support my family on and if not, he would keep it, and so he kept it, although he had every dollar of his pay for it. 

This was the fruits of Mr. William Branches religion, although a stray Presbyterian, but as I do not intend this to expose other people’s faults, I will let the above suffice, and resume my own travels and say that the above affair afforded another opportunity for me to leave father, mother, brothers, and sisters, house and land for the Gospel’s sake.

I hastened to start on my mission to Morgan County, Illinois.  Accomplished and started on the 16th of April, 1839, only having my family which consisted of a wife and five children.  That was all the company I had to travel with for the first hundred and twenty miles.  I was there lay weather-bound for a week on account of a storm which made the roads so bad that I could not travel, and while laying by a number of brethren came up, some from Canada and some from Kirtland, Ohio. 

Among that company was George A. Smith and his father and mother, and brother, John.  I fell in with them and we traveled on through mud and mire for two or three weeks and finally reached the place of destination for me, some time in May, namely, Morgan Country, Illinois.  There I stopped, finding the place of my appointment filled by previous action of the branch.  I was satisfied and concluded to make my way on to Far West, so I took leave of the brethren and traveled on in that direction until some time in the fore part of June, when I was brought down with a severe attack of sickness, so that I was obliged to camp.

By the way-side stood a big oak tree, and under it a nice plot of grass.  There I took up my abode for a little season.  This was at Huntsville, Randolph County, State of Missouri about one hundred and twenty-five miles from Far West.

After laying there for a few days, I was taken up by a good Samaritan and lodged in the house of a brother by the name of Edward Weaver, where my wants were amply provided for.  I soon began to revive and get better.  After laying there a few days, there came along another company from Kirtland, bound for Far West, and in that company was the Prophet Joseph’s father and mother, two brothers, namely Hyrum and William Smith, and their families. 

The old gentleman, the only living Patriarch then known in the Church was invited and entreated upon to stop and hold meetings which he did and it was a glorious meeting too, for the spirit of the Lord was poured out upon the capious Effrisian and there I had an open vision and presentment to much of the surprising of the saints, and especially that of the Smith family.  

And I proclaimed it to the congregation, and it affected the Old Patriarch so that he wept like a child and said the vision was true and from the Lord, which in a few weeks or months proved to be true, as will be seen by that which followed in the coming fall.  Father Smith and two sons tarried a few days with us after the meeting and organized the place or branch into a temporary stake of Zion for a resting place for the saints that were worn out in traveling form the East.
	
In which organization I was set apart by the, the Smiths, to take charge and preside over the same which I did to the best of my ability, until some time in August, when a message came to us to break up our organization and come to Caldwell County as there was a strong indication of hostilities by the mob.  

So we hastened to comply with the instructions received from the Prophet, and in a few days were on our way for Far West.  But the mob was getting so hostile that after traveling a day or two, we began to feel as though it was not safe to keep on the main traveled road, though the settlements, as the spirit of mobacracy was opposed to any more saints gathering to Far West, so we concluded to leave the main road and took a by-road that led through a thinly settled county, for about 15 or 20 miles where the settlement and road ended and we took across an uninhabited country without any road for about 40 miles, which brought us out at renown Hawn’s Mill, and from there through Caldwell Co., to within about 4 miles or 5 of Far West, where we concluded to stop and made our home in that place.

There was a large branch of the Church, known as Log Creek Branch so I bought me a snug little home consisting of a log house and blacksmith shop and seven acres of good land, under cultivation with a good rail fence around it, but that took all of my means to pay for it, but one yoke of oxen, one horse, and two cows.  Corn and pork were aplenty.  Corn being the main bread stuff then.  So I set to work at shoemaking and made my family comfortable again and in being the only high priest in the branch.  I accepted the appointment and all things went comfortable, not withstanding excitement reigned in the country around and hostilities increased daily by the mobs on the outside settlements in the adjoining counties, and finally by the middle of October hostilities ran so high that we received another message from the prophet, requesting us all in the out settlements to come into Far West City.

We readily compiled with the counsel and many of the brethren tore down their log houses and moved into the city, but I did not tear down my house, but went into the city with the rest of my brethren from that branch and took shelter in an old log cabin with three other families.  This required some little patience for a family by the name of Fowles did apostatize and went off with the mob and I have not heard from them since.

I will here say that after we arrived in the city there was quite a stir among the people for reports were daily and almost hourly that the mob was gathering on every side, so it kept us on the look all the time, day and night, until on or about, the 22nd of October, there came a report that the mob was ruining houses, destroying property and killing our brethren that had not gathered into Far West, but lived about twelve or fourteen miles out from Far West.  On hearing the report there was a company of about seventy men raised and dispatched to see what the trouble might be.  They traveled on until they came to the place of trouble near Crooked River as it was called.  There they came in contact with the mob which opened fire upon our brethren and quite a skirmish ensued which resulted in the death of David K. Patten, one of the twelve apostles, also Simeon Carter, and a young man by the name of Paterson Obunion and several more of the brethren badly wounded. 

On their arrival to the city, it threw a gloom over the whole place, but the most of the brethren maintained their integrity, but some faltered; yet there were faithful ones enough left to keep on the lookout and stand guard and do what was required of them, until about three of four days after, or on the 27th of October, 1838, while on duty or watching for the mob, lo and behold, we espied their glittering armor some two miles in the distance.  They came in the direction of our city, which produced some little stir in the place and in a few minutes there were about two hundred men both young and old mustered to the public squire in the city, the rest of the man being absent.  

We were immediately marched to the south boundary line of the city in the direction of the mob, to defend our wives and children and property from destruction.  When we arrived to our post the mob was coming down on to a low piece of ground on the borders of Goose Creek, where there was some scattering timber that took them out of sight, but some of them climbed up in the trees and looked over into the city and swore that they saw an army of men that would number thousands.  This we learned from our brethren that were prisoners then in their camp.  The sight of this great army brought terror to their camp which caused them to halt for a little time, but we soon saw a flag raised by a few men coming towards us.  A detachment or committee consisting of four men, namely Cornel (Colonel ?)George M. Hinkle, Judge Phelps, John Carrel, and Major Reed Peck.  They were chosen and soon sent with a white flag to meet the coming flag.  
	
They met in our sight, but we could not hear what passed between the parties, but they all went to the enemies camp together and in a short time the committee returned to our ranks and said that it was a government army sent out by Governor Boggs to investigate the difficulty existing between mob and Mormon, and settle the difficulty if possible.  They wanted Joseph and his councilors and the twelve to come immediately to their camp and hold council with them concerning the matter.  On hearing this, Joseph said he would go as he did not wish to contend or resist the government, so he with all the required brethren that was present, started with the committee, immediately for the army’s camp.  They soon met the flag born by a number of officers and to their great surprise, was delivered over by the committee to the officers as prisoners of war.  

We set to work with all our might and threw up a breast-work of such material as we could get, house logs, poles, wagon boards, slabs and wagon boxes and other materials such as we could gather through the night and when morning came we had about a half or three quarter of a mile of breastworks, good, considering our circumstances.  We had neither eaten or drank since the morning before, as our wives or children dare not come to us.

But after waiting some time in the morning our committee, again went to the camp to learn the result of the counsel.  After a short absence they returned to us saying that a treaty had been effected, in which we were to lay down our arms in evidence of our living as peaceful citizens and sign over our property to the State to pay the expenses of the war.  Joseph had agreed to all of this and that the army would be up soon to carry the treaty into effect, and that we must act accordingly.  That was a tough pill to swallow, however, if Joseph says so all right!

Sure enough, in a short time, we saw the army approaching, and they marched up to our ranks and formed a hallow square into which we were all marched by our Commander, Colonel Hinkle.  We were there ordered to lay down our arms, which we did, so that we were divested of every weapon for defense.  Even our large pocket knives were taken.  While this was going on, another square was formed and we marched into that, away from our arms in helpless condition, and we stood there waiting further orders.  Every now and then a woman would come in crying and saying that was would all be shot down in a few minutes.  The soldiers at the same time were busy picking their flints and priming their guns and making ready to fire, when their noble general said, “I suppose you are tired, you can sit down on the grass and rest a little”, which was quite a favor and we sat down, and the side of the square were my lot was cast was made up with painted demons, which proved to be the old Jackson County Militia.

After getting some instructions from the general we were allowed to go to our families within the city, but not to attempt to go out of the city at our peril, yet this was quite a privilege, as many of us had not eaten anything for nearly two days.  After supper we retired to our beds, for we were glad to get a little rest and we had been advised to keep our houses dark or we would be liable to get shot.  We could often hear guns firing, dogs yelping, hogs squealing and demons howling and yelling and cursing and swearing.  After spending the night thus amused, we arose in the morning and could see hogs, dogs, sheep laying dead in the street and gateways that led out of the city.  They had been shot by the ruffians that claimed they thought they were Mormons running away on all fours.  They also committed many other deprivations, such as robbing and stealing, and the worst of all did outrage and shamefully abuse some of our most worthy and virtuous females.  

I will here relate a short conversation that took place between a little boy of about twelve years by the name of Buduas Dustin and a Methodist preacher, a captain of a company and chaplain for the army by the name of Bogard, which took place as follows:  One evening, when the little boy was present the army was called to order to attend evening services and a solemn prayer and thanks to their unknown God for the glorious work that he was permitting and assisting them to perform, and when the prayer was finished the boy stood as if in deep mediation and said, “Mr. Bogard, can I ask you one question?”  “Yes, boy”, was the answer.  The boy proceeded by saying, “Mr. Bogard, sir, which way do you think is right for a person to have their eyes closed or open, when they pray?”  “Well, my boy, I suppose either would be acceptable if done in humility, but it looks more humiliating to have your eyes closes against the transitory objects around us and from the world.”  “Well,” said the boy, “I think, if I was engaged in such a work as you are, I should fear the devil would carry me off if they were shut.”  They then threatened his life for a young Mormon, but he said, “I am no Mormon.”  And he was not, and so escaped, but he subsequently joined the Church.

I will turn to the doings, or some of the doings of the day.  After breakfast we were all called to the public square in the city and then required to sign a deed to our property, to pay the expenses of the war.  Yet Joseph did not come nor we did not know but little that was going on, but I will here mention one thing that occurred.  The first night in camp there were four of our brethren that were prisoners in the allowed to come to the city which a brother by the name of Wm. Cary that lived in the house with me, (an old acquaintance that I had baptized in Canada some three years previous.), they brought him home on a board with his skull broken in with his own gun, by the hands of a mobber by the name of Wm. Dunnihoo.  Brother Gary died the next day, an innocent man and giving no offense but for his religion and must and did die a martyr.   

I will now say that after we had got mostly through the business of signing the deeds, we were called to witness one of the most heart rendering scenes – Joseph and his brethren were brought up from the camp and driven up to their own dear ones, where they were permitted to see their wives and children a few minutes to bid them an ever-lasting farewell, being told that they would never see them again.  They were then driven off by a ruthless mob, never to return.  But such was their condition, both husbands and wives in the hands and to the mercy of an unmerciful set of beings.  But the Lord over-rules all and delivered them out of their hands in his own good time.

We learned when Joseph and brethren were in camp, instead of being in honorable counsel with the officers, for which they were competent and abundantly qualified, they were suffering abuse and undergoing a mock trial by court martial for crimes alleged which they were never guklty (guilty) of.

But the court decided guilty, and sentenced Joseph and brethren in company to be shot the next morning at 8 o’clock.  General Daniphare with his command was appointed by court to execute the sentence, but he swore that he would not do it for he said it would be nothing but cold-blooded murder.

Consequently, early the next morning, Daniphare’s command was placed under marching orders and marched away about three miles from the main army so that he might not witness the scene, or be implicated with same.  He, Daniphare, being a noted lawyer, it began to create some uneasiness with the rest of the officers of the court martial, and they concluded to change their former decision and made a new one that would give Joseph a fair chance of life.  So they decided on sending them to Liberty Jail, among the old Jackson County mobbers, and so they did and sent some of them to guard them safely through.  Now, after the prisoners were gone and the business of the day finished, we were called upon to listen to a piece of valuable counsel and advice from one noble General Clark, and then be dismissed, which was the best of all the goings, the speech was nearly as follows: “Now, men, I will say that you have thus far complied with the treaty as made with your leaders by giving up arms and deeding over your property to pay the expenses of this war which you have been the instigators of, and I think you must feel as though you have been dealt very leniently with, as our orders were to exterminate with the treaty made, you will now be let go to carry out the rest of its stipulation, which is to leave the state of Missouri, by planting time in the spring or be exterminated or driven out at the point of the bayonet or rifle and one of the two things must be done.  Now on your dismissal.

“I will now give you a piece of good advice, when you are discharged to go and provide for the wants of your families and make speedy preparations to leave this state and hunt a place where ever you can and scatter about like other people and never gather together again in companies, not even of ten under presidents, prophets, or bishops and apostles to govern you.  If you do you will heed this command and advice it will be well with you, and I will here invite the blessings of the great unknown God upon you to help you to do so, Men, you are now dismissed to carry out these measures.”

Now after prowling about the city for a day or two more and gathering what they could best manage of our most valuable, they concluded to leave, which they did, taking with them a few apostates which we could well spare, and now was the time for us to go back to our homes that we had been obliged to leave and which most of us did.

I soon set about hunting my team which I had turned on the prairie when I came to the city.  I went in the direction of the soldier’s camping place and soon found the heads of my oxen lying in the road near their camp, and this stopped me from hunting any more.  I returned to the city and got the Widow Cary’s team to move us back home, on condition that I would take her with us and keep her and the team until she could leave the state, the mob having just killed her husband a few days previous.  I agreed to do so, which I did.

On arriving home I could find but one cow.  I had left two, but on looking a short time, I found the head and hide of the other who had been destroyed.  That left me with one horse and one cow to make up a team with which to leave the state in the spring.

I will here say that the most of the brethren from this branch came back to their old homes and soon forgot or neglected to observe or keep the counsel that was given at our dismissal from the army, for we did soon assemble ourselves together and rejoiced to think we were worthy to suffer for the gospel’s sake.  We did not have the Prophet or bishop to govern us, but would have rejoiced to have had them.

I suffice to say that I went to work at shoemaking and pork and corn were plenty and cheap and we had plenty to eat and though the course of the winter traded my horse and cow and some clothing for a good yoke of oxen, and though the generosity of a brother by the name of Ebenezer Brown, I obtained money and bought me another yoke of oxen which made me a good outfit for a team, and on the 12th day of March 1839, I, with my family in company with Brother Brown and others bid farewell to our Missouri home and started to seek a new home in the more congenial clime.

We traveled on without anything of note taking place until the latter part of March.  We then landed all safe in the little town by the name of Atlas on the border of the Great Mississippi bottom in the state of Illinois.

There we met a brother-in-law of mine, who beset me to stop with him a few days to which I consented, that separated me and Brother Brown, he taking the road leading North up the river in the direction of that subsequently became Nauvoo.  I stayed a few days in Atlas and in the time met with a chance to sell my team which I did and being indebted to Brother Brown for the money that bought part of it, I immediately set out to find him and pay him what I owed, which I did by traveling about 12 miles up the river to a little town called Pleasantville.  I there met Brother Brown and family.  We were glad to meet again, not knowing when we parted that we should ever meet again in this world.  But I payed him what I owed him and he insisted on my coming and settling in this place as the people were friendly and everything plenty to live on, so I looked around and soon found an old log cabin and three acres of ground which I rented and put the ground to corn and garden truck, which done well and I had plenty the coming year.

I will say here that about this time Joseph and Hyrum made their escape from Missouri and came to Quincy, Ill., about 30 miles up the river from where I stopped.  They soon called a meeting and gave some general instructions to the saints that were at the meeting and to set abroad to all the saints scattered about through all the country, and then immediately looking for a location to gather the saints, so that they might again be in one place as a body.

They soon succeeded in obtaining a place by purchasing a little town called Commerce, that had been mostly vacated on account of its being so very sickly, but the saints commenced gathering into Commerce like droves coming to their windows.  This was about 50 miles up the Mississippi River from Quincy.

I will now return to my own doings for a while.  I went to work on my little rented place, making garden and also shoemaking and enjoyed my new home very well until some time in the month of June, when I was visited by one of the old original high council.  After he found there were several saints in that part of the country, he called them together and organized us into a branch of the Church and I was set apart and chosen to take charge of the same and to hold meetings among ourselves, and if invited by the good responsible citizens to preach to them.  Which I did, and the Lord blessed my labors and many believed and were baptized and the work prospered until October.

Then there was to be conference held in Commerce, October 6th, 1839.  I went and another such sight my eyes never beheld, that portion of the assembly that had lived in Commerce during the summer looked more like ghosts that had neither flesh nor blood or but very little, yet they seemed to be satisfied and glad to think they were able to attend conference.  They organized the place into a stake of Zion and changed the name of the place from Commerce to that of Nauvoo, a resting place, and in the organization I was chosen as one of the high council, but was subsequently released by telling Joseph what I was doing and what the prospect was in Pike County where I had been laboring during the summer, about eighty miles from Nauvoo.  He told me to return and continue preaching and when the branch reached the number of 100, he would then come and organize the branch a stake of Zion.  I went home and to my field of labor and doors were opened on every hand.

I preached and baptized and in about two weeks the branch numbered 112.  I let Joseph know according to his instructions and he being over taxed with business, sent his brother Hyrum who was his first counselor, and Bishop George Miller.

They came and organized the branch into a stake of Zion for a resting place for the saints that were gathered from the east and from the south.

In the organization I was ordained and set apart to preside and William Allred, Bishop.  We were then instructed to obtain a piece of land and lay it off into town lots and build a meeting house and provide for the comforts and conviences of the saints as they gathered in, which succeeded in doing.  We built a frame meeting house, if I remember right, 36 by 40 feet and so far completed it that we held our meetings in it.

Many of the old citizens joined the Church and all went on comfortable until some time in the summer or fall of 1862, when mobcracy and persecution began to show their heads.  By this time I had got me a nice little home and was comfortable situated, but a message came from the Prophet to discontinue and immigrate to Hancock County and most all the branch submitted to the call.

In the spring of 1843, I moved with my family and located in a place called Green Plain in the vicinity of Warsaw in Hancock County, with the notorious Levi Williams for one of my neighbors.

I there bought a farm on the terms and went to improving, built me a good house and small grist mill and put about twenty acres of land and a good fence around it, and was on good terms with my neighbors although most of them were gentiles, but they professed to be much pleased with my enterprise in the place, and all went well with me until sometime in June 1844.  Then there were reports about Joseph from Nauvoo, that produced some little excitement, for priests and lawyers and apostates had combined together to again make trouble.  The men in the neighborhood where I lived organized to go to Nauvoo and arrest Joseph.  They came and invited me to go with them to take Joseph, but I refused.  They wanted to know if I would go if the governor ordered me to go, I said; “No, I will not go if the devil himself ordered me to go against Joseph, for his people are my people and where he goes, I will go also.”

This appeared to vex them a little although we had always been on good terms as neighbors, and they said, “Then you will have to leave, for you can’t live here, although we like you as a neighbor.”  So they left me and started for Nauvoo, with old Colonel Williams as their leader, which resulted in the martyrdom of Joseph, the Prophet, and Hyrum, the Patriarch.  This was done in Carthage Jail, June 27, 1844.

Then the desperadoes came back to Green Plain, without having the black thoroughly washed from their necks and faces and they never could get it from their characters or consciences, but they did not interfere with me any more until about the 20th of September, 1845.  Although they engaged in a little town called Lima that was settled mostly with saints, in burning houses and plundering and some times killing our brethren and one day there came an armed force of about sixty men, they set fire to my hay and grain that was……(This portion of story not available).

I will just say here that at the time I hat two little boys laying at the point of death.  One four and a half, and the other two and a half years old.  Albert Edward, oldest and Parley Pine, the youngest.  They were carried out into the woods and bed made on the ground with bed and bedding under them and a large bedstead set over them with plenty of bedding and clothes over them to keep from getting wet with the heavy rain that was rapidly approaching.

I will say that while the woman and some of the generous crowd that volunteered to help her, were carrying out some of the things, the rest of the crowd divided the straw out of a bed into four corners of the room and set fire to it.  The woman tired to put it out, but some of the ruffians took her by the shoulders and put her out of doors and she was not in a condition to be handled rough with safety.  The house burned down with the rest of its contents.

I was obliged to flee to save my life.  I remained out until there came on a very heavy thunder storm then I ventured out to see what had become of my family.  I found them all alive and no personal injury done, but my house and hay and considerable fence was burned to the ground, which threw my field open to the cattle, where I had about a thousand bushel of corn, mostly in the shock, but all exposed to the ravages of hogs, sheep and cattle, which were roaming at large in abundance.

My wife begged to leave as the mob was hunting me the last time she saw of them so I was obliged to take shelter in a large shock of corn as it was raining hard.  I lay there until it began to leak through onto me, so I was obliged to crawl out and I then went to see how my family was getting along and found them more comfortable situated, for a brother came along and carried the sick children and their bed and bedding into the mill which they did not burn, supposing it belonged to another man, although they had got some wet in changing locations.  I remained with them until near daylight, then I ventured to go to my nearest neighbor, a Baptist preacher, by the name of Geo. Walker.

When I arrived and began to tell what the mob had done he said, “Mr. Draper, I know it, I saw it all, but I could do you no good, for I feared they would destroy me next.  Is there anything I can do for you?”  I said I wished to get his wagon to move my family from this mob and I would return it.  He said, “there is my wagon, take it and if you return it, all well, and if not all well.”
I then went back to help my wife to gather the little fragment left.  By this time daylight appeared and while we were busy preparing to leave, lo and behold, we saw ten armed me, they were in pursuit of me again, and I was obliged to flee and I made my escape, but it was upon my hands and knees through the brush.  I succeeded in reaching another neighborhood.  There I got a young man to go and let my folks know where I was and help them pack up there things and bring them to me, which he did.

I then took them to Pike Co., a distance of sixty miles where I got them into a house with my wife’s brother.  After that I had them comfortably situated.  The next day being the 6th of October, 1845, my wife was confined and brought me another son, and the other two little boys that were sick soon began to get better.  After all was apparently safe and provided for I then took leave and started for Nauvoo, a distance of about eighty miles.  Some part of this, I had to pass through a section of country where the mob was daily parading and doing damage and seeking the lives of men that would claim to be Latter-Day-Saints or Mormons.

I passed through unharmed and arrived safe in Nauvoo where Brigham and Heber, who were then the President of the Church, I told them what I had done, and how and where I had left my home, which was highly approved.

I then asked their counsel for my further movements, which they gave as follows: “Brother Williams, if you wish to remain with the saints, go back and take care of your family where they are the best you can through the winter and make every effort you can to get ready and go with us next spring to the Rockies Mountains, but come again to Nauvoo in about two months and get your endowments.”  Which I did on the 27th day of January, 1846.  While I was there, several of the brethren crossed the Mississippi river over into Iowa, then on their way for the mountains, but I returned back to Pike Co. and there made speedy preparations to follow on in the spring, which I did and left Pike Co. about the 20th of April 1846 and went to Nauvoo and added some to the family and to the outfit.

On the first day of May we crossed the Mississippi river and took the train to follow those that had started before for the mountain through a wilderness country where no white lived.  We made quite a company and I was chosen their Captain.  We traveled on some 200 miles and nothing worthy of note took place, but one night where we had camped, to our great surprise, up came Brigham and Heber, returning from the Missouri River, the place which they had reached.  They brought us the information that the United States Officers had met them and called for 500 able bodied men from our traveling company to go to Mexico to fight their battles.  This was quite a damper to us, not withstanding we traveled on, but Brigham and Heber went on east to meet their companies.

When we got within about 6 miles of the Missouri River, we came to a halt and struck camp to wait for Brigham and army officers and Colonel Thomas L. Cane (Kane), who had heard of the call made on us, and come to witness the result.  After a short consultation in council with Brigham and the officers, it was decided to respond to the call made, and a call for volunteers then issued which was readily responded to, and within twenty four hours the required number of 500 was more than made up.

There was immediately a large bowery erected at a little place known as trading point, settled only by Indians, and their traders on the bank of the Missouri.  There we had a jolly parting dance, and the next morning being the 16th day of July 1846, which was the parting between husband and wives, fathers, and children, brothers and sisters, and so 500 of our able bodied men were marched away across a 2000 mile desert to fight the battles of the United States from which we had just been driven.

Now I will leave those that have gone and turn to those that are left on the prairies.  We could look in every direction and see the prairie dotted with wagons and tents and speckled with cattle whose owners were gone, now it was that something must be done for the women and children that were left un-provided for and without protection and in an Indian country, so a meeting was immediately called and the country divided up into districts or wards, and bishops appointed and bishop to each ward.  It feel to my lot to be one of them and when I went to look up those that were in my district, there were 33 families and each of those bishops was to take charge and provide for all that was left in the ward that fell to him, so we immediately set about the work of gathering up the cattle and getting herdsmen to take care of them and the next move was to provide shelter for the folks and provide for the stock, as we were left with so few men that we could not move on any further until the brethren returned from the army, for some other way was provided for our deliverance, so we set to with all our mind and might and strength.

We built log cabins and brought some from the Indians that was about to be drove from their homes by the government, as we had already been.  I will mention here that Brigham and a large number of the saints crossed the river to the west side onto the Omaha Lands not yet owned by the United States.

They built up quite a little town with over 500 houses, but the rest of the saints remained in the east side of the river on the Pottawattamie Land, that the government was about to take possession of, but they were soon gathered into more compact bodies where they could better provided for, and more easily protected.  I located a little place called Council Point, where there was quite a settlement a comfortable house on it.  I had built two cabins before as my family was large, but I was soon comfortably situated.

The saints kept flocking in so that in a short time we had a fine little town and it soon became necessary to have a better organization and it was desired to organize Council Point into a branch and have ordained a bishop to do business in a church capacity, so I was chosen and ordained bishop and done whatever business that became necessary in the branch by the Church law.

But by this time there was circumstances and characters in our midst that Church law did not fully provide for and they were not willing to be governed by what laws we had.

Iowa was not organized with territorial government, consequently was without any civil code to govern them, so in the absence of other law, we went to work and organized a provisional government with a law making department, and appointed or elected officers to administer the laws as they were made or as occasions required, in which department I held a position.  We went on administering the laws as they were made by issuing writs, punishing crime, assessing fines and collecting them and settling in judgment in cases of debt, and using the means for enforcing Missouri and all other business necessary to preserve peace and safety in the county.

Everything moved on quietly some went to farming, and some to peddling off their surplus clothing and such articles as they could best spare to the merchant to obtain bread for the destitute, and so we were all provided for, and the next year we raised plenty for our own consumption and the country soon bore testimony in thrift.  All things moved all well under our mode of government, then we ceased further operation under the provisional government, and sent our court records to Washington, which there met with highest approval.

I will now say a few words about the company that crossed the river and built up Winter Quarters, of which a large number died from privation and hardships they had to endure.  However, those that were sick and did survive began to revive when winter set in and by spring had so far recovered that a company was raised and some time in April 1847 with Brigham at their head, started as a company of pioneers consisting of about 100 men to cross the trackless plain where nothing but the savage and the wild beast roamed.

This was to seek a home for the saints in the valley of the mountains where they could serve the Lord and keep his commandments.  The various incidents of their travel I shall not attempt to write, but leave it for better writers and those that have the sad experience and let it suffice by saying that they arrived in safety to the valley of the Great Salt Lake, July 24th 1847, and then located the present and grounds, which stand forth in evidence of the greatness and wisdom and perseverance of its founders.

I will here say in the spring of 1848, all that was able, left Winter Quarters (as it was called with its 500 houses) and started to join the saints in Salt Lake Valley, and those that were not able to go were taken back across the river into Iowa and there provided for by the brethren who were doing well, building up flourishing little towns and making and cultivating large farms which produced for the inhabitant.

The chief place or headquarters for public business was Canesville (Kanesville) so called because of the kindness and gentlemanly conduct of one Colonel Thomas L. Cane (Kane), who came to visit and witness our afflictions soon the gentiles began to come to Canesville (Kanesville) with stores of goods, which afforded abundance or necessaries and luxuries and convinces to fit out for the mountains and plenty for them that stayed longer.

About this time and previous, the brethren had returned from the Mexican war and resumed the care of their own families.  That liberated those that had the responsibility before they came.  Now it was in the spring of 1849, I was counseled to immigrate to Salt Lake that season, I responded to the call and made speedy preparation to go with a company that was to immigrate that season, and on the 5th of July I bid farewell to my home and friends, at Council Point and started to join the company at old Winter Quarters where they organized.  I was appointed by Geo. A. Smith to take part in the oversight of the traveling company in connection with Judge Alley and Judge Clark.

We then started out to cross the plains for Great Salt Lake.  We traveled on slowly and nothing special occurred worthy of note.  There was but little sickness and no deaths in camp, but I will name one little incident that occurred in the 2nd day of October near South Pass.  We were caught in a great storm with our cattle and horses.  That weakened our team some but after the storm ceased we shoveled our way and traveled on again.  We did not travel many miles until we came to where there was no snow and all was fair weather, which continued until the 26th day of October, When we arrived safe in Salt Lake City, and broke up camp, having been four months and a half on the plains, but was happy now to meet our brethren that had also come up through great tribulation and made them a home in the mountains.

I then stopped a few days with my brother Zemira,  in which time I met with a chance to rent a house and lot for one year.  My family being large, it required some little exertion to provide for their wants, for flour raised before the harvest to the enormous price from seventy-five to one dollar per pound, and it was hard to get seed grain, but I succeeded in getting both my family did not suffer or do without bread.

During the winter I bought me a little farm and rented another about six miles south of the city, it being too far to go back and forth to farm it and tend crop.

I bought a small log cabin and some time in February moved a part of my family to Mill Creek, where my farm was.  I put the city lot in with potatoes and farm with wheat and corn and raised a good crop of each, so I had plenty for the ensuing year and some to spare.

In the summer of fifty-three was a good new settlement started on what was then called South Willow Creek (now Draper) about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City, I was invited to come and settle there.  I did, and in November 1850 moved my whole family there.  I took up land and made me a good farm and raised plenty of grain and cattle and horses and the settlement increased so it became necessary to have the place organized into a branch of the Church.

I was called to preside and serve them as bishop, having been ordained to that office before.  I served in that capacity until the close of 1857 and in the spring of 1858, I was obliged to leave a good home again and go south in the general move.  I went as far south as Spanish Fork, about 42 miles in distance, there I stopped and located.

I never expected to go back to my old home again.  I there purchased four houses and lots and about eighty acres of land of which over fifty acres was good farming land and the rest grass land.

I sued to raise plenty of grain for my own use and had lots to spare.  And I done well until the year of 1862, then the grass-hoppers and crickets destroyed my crops so they proved almost an entire failure.  The year ’63 as also followed with another failure and grain of all kinds raised to an enormous price, wheat $5.00 a bushel and wood was hard to get, being a long ways off, and I had four fires to keep up and my oldest boys had all married and left me with a large family of little helpless children with only their mothers to help me.

Putting all these disadvantages together, I found it taking off my best property faster then I could stand, one bushel of wheat per day for bread or five dollars and two loads of wood per week and it from two to three days to get a load, and I found I could not stand that way of living much longer, so I concluded to sell out and immigrate to Sanpete County, where cedar wood was plenty and where we got most of our bread stuff from.

So in the fall of 1863, I sold out my property in Spanish Fork for less than half what it cost me and early in ’65 immigrated to Moroni, Sanpete County where I bought a house and lot and about15 acres of land for which I paid nine hundred dollars in property.  I also bought one third share of an old grist mill, worth four or five hundred dollars for which I agreed to pay fifteen hundred dollars for one third of the mill.

My property was going very fast for bread at five dollars a bushel and I could make my bread with the mill although I pay five hundred dollars down in property.  I thought I would have my share in the mill left and if I paid it out for bread I should have nothing and I got about as near that as I wanted for I only realized for the whole after spending bread with it by working hard and raising some on the land I bought.

Since mill and land are all gone, I have had some anxieties, but I have nearly got through with all, for my young and helpless children that I have spoken of before are now grown and are men and women are to take care of themselves and lend a helping hand to their mother’s and as for myself, I think I shall not need any help, for I do not wish to be burdensome to my children or any one else.

I will say here that I have lived in Moroni hardly 17 years, but am sorry to say that in this short period I have suffered more in body and mind than I have all the rest of my life, although I have spent nearly fifty-five years of my life in this Church.  When I was about to sink under the weight and influence of temptation, the Lord verified his promise, wherein he said, “You shall not be tempted more than you are able to bear, but in every hour of temptation I will make way for your escape,” and he did, by sending his servant, President John Taylor on or about the 18th day of August 1880.  He invited me into the house of Bishop J.W. Irons, and after being seated he asked me a few questions which I answered briefly.

He then called upon one of his council, George. Q. Cannon, and one of the apostles, Erastus Snow, they layed their hands on my head and re-ordained me to all the offices and all the various grades of priesthood that I ever had been previously ordained to and confirmed, and in addition ordained me to the office of Patriarch after the ancient order and reconfirmed all the blessings that had ever been pronounced upon my head by those that had administered to me before by ordination or otherwise, and that seemed to impart new life and vigor to both body and mind and spirit.

But I find that I am on the decline so far as my bodily strength is concerned and must ere long lay off this mortal tabernacle and my spirit to rest or to join those that have gone before, who have passed through great tribulations and have conquered the last enemy, and for this reason I have written this imperfect narrative that my children and grand-children and finally all my posterity to the latest generation may see what their progenitor and those that he associated with in this Church had to pass through for the sake of the Gospel.

I now feel thankful that I have the privilege of bearing my testimony to the truth of what I have written although there may be some little errors in dates, but nothing designedly or that would destroy the truthfulness of this narrative. 

I also feel to bear testimony to the truth of the everlasting Gospel as introduced to this generation by Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and is now being preached by his successors and Elders of Israel that are going forth to carry glad tidings of salvation to the nations of the earth.

And I feel to join in the labor by calling upon all men, Jews and Gentiles, bond and free men priest and people at home or abroad, all who have not obeyed the gospel to listen and hear and believe and baptize for the remission of your sins, and have hands laid on you by one who has authority for the gift of the Holy Ghost and you shall receive it, for the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are afar off as many as the Lord our God shall call.

Now in conclusion, I will say that I have been some two weeks, this imperfect narrative, and will now come to a close on this eleventh day of December, in the year of our Lord One Thousand eight hundred and eighty one, (Dec 11, 1881) which makes me seventy four (74) years seven months and seven days old, and the husband of five living wives and the father of fifty-one children, and grandfather to about one hundred and great grandfather to about twenty more.

I now leave my blessing upon them all, and ask my Heavenly Father to seal the blessings of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob upon their heads, that they may be honorable members of his Church and kingdom even so Lord let it be.  Amen.

He was fond of reading the scriptures and was early convinced of the necessity of baptism for remission of sins.  He desired to join a church that believed in such baptism, so he was baptized into the Baptist Church, which he considered as the best one according to his convictions at the time.

In 1796 he married Lydia Lathrop, daughter of Isaac and Lucy Pike Lathrop.  She was the third great-granddaughter of Reverend John Lathrop who was exiled from England and came to America because of his break from the Church of England, for religious freedom, in 1623.  (He was the common ancestor of such prominent church men as the Prophet Joseph Smith, Wilford Woodruff, Orson and Parley P. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Peter Newton, William Draper, Stillman Pond, and many others, even Franklin D. Roosevelt traces his ancestry back to this Lathrop.)  She was born Nov. 5, 1775 in Norwich, New Haven, Conn.

A poem was written by a daughter of his son, Artemesia Anderson about the trip when William and Lydia moved to Canada.

There was a child born.  He was William Draper Jr.  He was the fifth child (although the poem mentions three earlier children) my grandfather, Zemira, was born Feb. 27, 1812.

After being in full Baptist membership for fifteen years, he began to be criticized for believing and teaching that the scriptures were to be understood in accordance to their obvious purport, that the prophecies in the Bible were going to be fulfilled, and that the Israelites would be gathered.  He continued to believe as his conscience dictated, however.

Then in 1833 he heard Brigham Young preach Mormonism when he was on his Canadian mission.  As soon as he heard it he recognized the truths that he had been searching for all his life, and asked for baptism.  He was baptized and confirmed the 25th of March, 1833 by Brigham Young (and Joseph Young assisted in the confirmation).  This was in the Township of Laborough, Canada.  He was ordained to the priesthood in June 1833, and later in the same month he was ordained an Elder by the same Brigham young. 

In 1835 he emigrated to Kirtland, Ohio, and in 1836 he went back to Canada on a mission in company with John E. Page where they baptized many persons and organized a large branch of the church, and in 1837 he was ordained a High Priest under the hands of Don Carlos Smith and his counselors.  

On January 2, 1837 he joined with the other two thirds of the Saints forming the Kirtland Safety Society Anti-Banking Company.

On March 13, 1838 because according to the Church Journal History he as one of the Seventies that met to form the governing resolutions to rule them on the proposed move to Missouri.

13,histories,1165963864,,,,"The History of Mary Lee Bland as Told to a Granddaughter.",,,,,,1,,0,,0,0,NULL,0,,,NULL,0,0,"Wm.  Fletcher Ewell; son of Pleasant Ewell and Barbara Fauber of Palmyra, Albermarle, Va. Was born in 1815. He married Mary Lee Bland, Daughter of John and Sarah C. Lee Bland.

(The history of Mary Lee Bland as told to a grand daughter)

I, Mary Lee Bland Ewell, was left to bear the responsibility of providing for and rearing my family; too proud to ask assistance from my wealthy father by whom I had been disinherited because I had married a “Mormon” and had affiliated with the “Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,” and disobeyed his mandate that I marry a man of his choice; son of his friend and neighbor whose plantation and estate adjoined ours.

Our fathers had planned each to give a large parcel of adjoining land to Dale and me as a wedding gift. The engagement was to be announced when Dale came home from law school and I from boarding school.

Dale and I broke up almost immediately after his arrival home because of ungentlemanly conduct. I tried to keep it from father as I felt he would not understand.

Faithful old “Mamy Chloe” helped me to avoid Dale when he tried to see me again. Whenever he was seen coming I would slip out quickly and go for a ride on “Old Betsy.”

One day no one was around to saddle her, so I did it myself. The cince [cinch] was not tight enough and while riding in the woods, some distance from home, the saddle turned, throwing me to the ground, injuring my back and my ankle.

As I lay there feeling unable to rise, a young man came along, bound my ankle and took me home. This young man introduced himself as William Fletcher Ewell, a medical student on vacation for the summer. During this vacation he was doing missionary work for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, known as “Mormon.”

He was heartily welcomed and invited to make our home his own as long as he desired. This new religion was listened to and agreed with at first. Then one day father went to town and came back a changed man, demanding an audience with the Dr. He had found in the community that the teachings of Joseph Smith and the Mormons were very unpopular. They had let father know that if he continued to entertain and encourage the young missionary that he would be an outcast. This was more than father could bear as his standing in the community was something very [dear] to father’s life.

At first father tried to get Wm. to give up teaching or believing this religion and when that was to no avail father commanded him in no uncertain terms to leave, and when I pleaded both for the new religion and for Wm. I was ordered up to my room and forbidden to see Wm or leave the room until I changed my mind, and he looked [locked] the door of my room.
I felt my heart would break for I loved Wm and had a firm faith in the teaching which he had given us. I threatened to run away but Mamy Chloe said that would break my poor ill mother’s heart.

A week went by. Then came a message from Wm by faithful Mamy Chloe. He wanted to know if I would be willing to go with him as his wife and be with the Saints.

My mind was made up. I knew the gospel was true and was worth any sacrifice, money and social position meant nothing to me in comparison to a life of usefulness with the one I loved. Mother was in sympathy and offered to help see that we could be together for she loved Wm as a son and wanted to see me marry for love rather than social position and to please parents as she had done.

It was decided that we would meet the next night before moonrise where Wm had found me that first day in the woods.  My father in the meantime had offered me a trip to Paris hoping that would make me see things his way. I was not interested. Mama sent a purse full of money and a box of jewelry to me by Mamy Chloe as she was not permitted to come to me. Mamy also informed me that she had been given to me and that she would not think of letting me go without her to help me.

I made my excape [escape] through the 2nd story window down the rose trellis.  Sammy had 2 horses ready and waiting; one for Mamy Chloe and one for Wm. and me.  I left with a good-bye letter to Mama with Zacery, my brother, who was in sympathy with me.

We met Wm at the appointed place and rode all night in order to get far enough away that father would not follow. 
  
Wm entered medical school and that fall my brother wrote that mother was still ill, her pleadings to him to accept us on a visit were in vain as was her pleading for the next day we found a minister in a small town in Kentucky and were married with Mamy Chloe as my witness.  I was not yet 18 and Wm just 22.
.
The following hear [year] our first son was born while we were in Missouri with the Dr’s family during vacation.  Mamy Chloe cared for him as she had cared for me. In due time another son came to us and two years later a daughter, whom we named Sarah Elizabeth for, dear Mamma who still had not been permitted to see me.

The family Dr, finally told papa that if he desired to keep his wife he had best let her see the daughter and grandchildren she had pined for so long in her weak condition.

Papa consented and we were sent for. Wm went promptly, even Papa seemed happy to see us and loved the children.  Our visit seemed to give new life to Mamma.

Our happiness was complete until the day papa said, “Dr. Ewell, I want to have a talk with you.  You seem to have made Mary Lee very happy and while I can’t forgive you for taking her away as you did. I’ll give you the strips of land we had planned to give Mary Lee and I’ll build you a house as become our rank and you can practice medicine right here. You have made Mary Lee’s mother happy and the Dr. says my wife hasn’t long to live. But of course you will have to give up that abominable religion of yours for any social prestige among our kind.”

Wm thanked him for his kind offer but said, “We cannot repudiate the truth of the gospel.” We were asked to leave and I was disinherited.

Wm had finished school that year.  Mother soon passed away and my brother wrote that my portrait was thrown into the attic and my name taken from the family record in the bible.

My jewels went one at a time in those times that followed. Another little girl, Barbara Ann was born while we were living at Winter Quarters. Then came the call for volunteers to go to Mexico.  Dr. Ewell was among those who marched away on the longest military march in history, about 2,000 miles.

Three months after his goodbye our son William was born.  Although there was never a shot fired by the battalion in this conquest, they fought with the wild bulls which gathered first in curiosity and finally attacked and gored to death several mules, some hitched to wagons and some pack mules.  

This is a story told by him.

“The troops were ordered to march with their guns unloaded, but in the presence of such danger the men had loaded their guns without waiting for orders to do so.  The officers were riding, the men walking of course and one ferocious beast charged and was only about 18 feet from me. I was ordered to load my gun to try to save my life.  I stood a second knowing my gun was already loaded.  The officer ordered me to run, but instead, I lifted my gun, for no son of Virginia, nor a Soldier of the Mormon Battalion would run from danger.  I took aim at the curl between the eyes of the oncoming beast, pulled the trigger and he dropped dead at my feet.”	

 “There was much suffering from lack of water and necessities, poor food, and hardships and by the time the Battalion had reached San Diego Mission on the Pacific Coast where the encampment was made and the famous march was completed I had become ill but could not give up, I knew I must get home to my family.

 (Colonel Cook’s Bulletin lauded the Battalion for its achievement and faithfulness in service to our country.  He said, “Who with crowbar and pick had cut their way over trachless [trackless] wasteland and through mountains that would defy anything save wild goat and howed [hewed] a pass through a chasm of living rock more narrow than our wagons; through wilderness, wild animals and savage Indians without an experienced guide, dug deep wells, preparing a trail for future travelers to enjoy.  They were veterians [veterans] but must now prepare to drill and train for system and order which was necessary for all soldiers.)
Wm. Said, “We all had an opportunity to clean up and doctor our sore feet, for some had marched shoeless and feet were wrapped in rags. We had a hoars [coarse] growth of beard and tangled hair cut to the tips of our ears.  We also got some rest which I needed.”  “The company in wich [which] I enlisted was detailed the following month to Los Angeles as a protection against hostile Indians, where a fort was erected on a hill commanding a view of the city and vicinity.  The conquest of Calif from Mexico was easily achieved.  Freemont with 60 Americans defeated Gen. Castro June 1846 (?) and Calif. Became U.S. teritory [territory].

 “The Mormon Battalion arrived too late to participate in the conquest, but in time to be assigned the task of hawling [hauling] the longest pole from the San Bernadin [Bernardino] Hills, that has ever been erected for a liberty pole in which I proudly participated and unfurling our stars and stripes for the first time  (4 of July, 1847 celebration) over Los Angeles in the name of the U.S. of America.”

During this time with the help of Mamy Chloe we were doing all we could to get to the mountains in the west, taking care of the little ones and praying for the safety of our loved ones.

The years period of inlistment [enlistment] was up, and inducements to the Battalion for renlistment [reenlistment] were made by Gen. Kearney because of their achievement.  He said to Sargent [Sargeant] Tylor, “Napoleon Bonepart [Boneparte] crossed the Alps but these men have crossed the continent.” A few reinlisted [reeinlisted] but most of them were anxious to get home to their families.

A messenger arrived from S.L. Valley with letters telling of the arrival of Bro. Young and others who on July 25th had hoisted the flag of the U.S. on Ensign Peak. Then Mexican Territory. Bro. Young had advised members of the Battalion to remain in Calif. for employment for the winter to earn sufficient means to bring their families west in the spring.

Dr.’s health had not improved so he desired to get to his family whom he thought in Utah.  On arriving in S.L. Valley with many others found that his family was not there.  He at once left for Winter Quarters with his brother, joined the returning men at Pueblo and arrived home at last.  How happy we were to be reunited and he to see his year old son for the first time.

His health seemed to improve some, he was home and we were happy, then privations in that terrible winter of 1847-48 caused a relapse and after a promise exacted from me that I would take the family and go with the saints to Zion, he passed from this life in my arms, leaving me grief stricken and facing maternity again with Mamy Chloe my only attendant.  Little Mary Jane was born four months after her father’s death.

We then set about to keep our pledge that we go to S.L. the Zion of the mountains, and oh, how I missed him, always so faithful to the church, so kind and true.

I could have gone back to luxury at home by reputiating [repudiating] our faith but was not tempted, even in the face of poverty, so in about two years my faithful Mamy Chloe helped me bring my family to S.L.  We located in Cottonwood and Mamy taught me to spin and weave materials for our cloths, carpets for the floor, how to card the wool, to make quilts and she taught me how to weave straw hats like the darkies made in the south.  I managed to create a little fancy style and Mamy Chloe sold them to the stores and others, thus we made our living until my sons were old enough to earn and make a home for us.

Poor old Mamy Chloe loved the gospel, I taught her to read, and she often remarked, “I’d be willin honey to be skinned alive if I could jus go in dat temple”

Even after the slaves were freed by Pres. Lincoln she did not desire her freedom.  No one ever knew her grief leaving her own boy Sammy, but being slaves they learned never to complain at seperations [separations].  I am sure I can never know what her great devotion to Miss Mary Lee, as she always called me, cost her and how she softened all my hardships wherever she could.

I never made an effort to recover my rights in my fathers estate.  However I feel that I have been compensated by living in the shadow of God’s Temple.  I am a descendant of Henry Lee, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and 2nd cousin of Gen. Robert E. Lee, of which I am proud.  My mother was Sarah C. Lee.  I love my country and never hear “The Star Spangled Banned [Banner]” without a feeling of gratitude and exaltation. I will never go back home now, but I hope that some of my posterity will go down South and rescue the portrait of little Mary Lee Bland.  (She died May 24, 1898. She did work in the temple for many of her family.)  She is buried at Santaquin, Utah. (Dr. W.F. Ewell was buried in Winter Quarters Cemetery, where a park was later made and a monument erected to those who died during the terrible winters of 1847 and 1847.

My father was married the 22nd day of November, A.D. 1785 to Triphena _____.  My father and grandfather emigrated, soon after my father was married, to Rupert, Bennington County, Vermont, from Suffield, Connecticut, where my father remained until I was about six years of age.  I then left my father and went to the Town of Lewis, about six miles from my father’s, and lived with John Gibbs and in June 1813 I left John Gibbs and went to my father and there remained until the 7th day of October following and then enlisted into the service of the United States, with my brother Martin N. Harmon with our father’s consent and shortly after joined the army, stationed at Burlington, Vermont.  We remained there a few months, and then crossed Lake Champlain with the army under the command of Colonel Clark to Plattsburgh and joined Gen’l Hampton’s army and remained there a few months.

Sometime in the month of March 1814 my father came and visited us at Plattsburgh.

On the 30th of March was fought the battle of LaColle Mill, a large fortified stone house at which Major Hancock commanded, who was the British officer.

On the day which our father left us we took up the line of march from Plattsburgh to LaColle Mill and our father went to the town of Jay to get married to a Mrs. Bunbar which took place on the 30th at the time we were engaged in the battle in hearing of the cannon.  

We had several skirmishes with the British and Indians before we reached LaColle Mill in one of which I received a sleight wound from an Indian’s tomahawk.

At LaColle Battle my brother and myself was on the right wing of the army under the Command of Col. Clark in Gen’l Smith’s Brigade.   We were exposed to a galling fire from the enemy and my brother received a mortal wound in his breast while fighting by my side and died on the 17th day of April following at Little Sharzee, New York and was buried there in the honors of war.

I then returned with part of the army by way of Plattsburgh to Burlington, Vermont and there reenlisted on the 5th of June during the war, and left for Rutland County, Vermont where I remained in the recruiting service a few months and was appointed a Corporal.  We then marched for Buffalo, New York from thence we crossed Lake Erie to Fort Erie, Upper Canada.  While there we received a continual cannonading and combating from the enemy for several weeks and on the 17th of September we fought a general battle and spiked several pieces of cannon, took 800 prisoners and left upwards of 1,000 of the enemy dead upon the field of battle.  We lost 571 men.

When General Brown, observing that the enemy had just completed a battery which could open a most destructive fire, the next day planned a sortie which has been considered a military chef d’oeuvre. 

The British force consisted of the brigades of 1,500 men each, each one of which was stationed at the works in front of Fort Erie.  The other two occupied a camp two miles in the rear.
	
The design of General Brown was to “storm the batteries, destroy the cannon and roughly handle the brigade on duty before those in reserve could be brought up.  A road had previously been opened by Lieutenant Riddle and Frazer, in a certain route through the woods within pistol shot of the flank of the line of batteries, and with such secrecy as to have escaped the notice of the enemy.

At two o’clock, the troops were drawn up in readiness to make the sortie.  The division commanded by General Porter, was composed of riflemen and Indians, under Colonel Gibson, and two columns, one on the right command by Colonel Wood, the left commanded by General Davis of the New York militia.  This was to proceed through the woods to the road which had been opened, while the right division of the troops in the ravine already mentioned, was stationed between the fort and the enemy’s works, under General Miller, with orders not to advance until general Porter should have engaged their flank.

The command of General Porter advanced with so much celerity and caution that when they rushed upon the enemy’s flank, they gave the first intimation of their approach.  A severe conflict for a moment ensued, in which those gallant officers, Colonel Gibson and colonel wood, fell at the head of their columns, and the command devolved on Lieutenant Colonel McDonald, and Major Brooks.  In thirty minutes possession was taken of both batteries in this quarter, together with a blockhouse in the rear, and the garrison made prisoners.  Three twenty-for pounders were rendered useless and their magazine blown up by Lieutenant Riddle, who narrowly escaped the effects of the explosion.

At this moment the division of General Millercame up; General Brown, having heard the firing, had ordered it to advance.  In conjunction with Colonel Gibson’s column, he pierced between the second and third line of batteries, and after a severe contest, carried the first of these.  In this assault general Davis fell, at the head of his volunteers.  The whole of these batteries and the two block houses, being in possession of the Americans, General Miller’s division inclined to the more formidable battereies toward the lake shore.  At this moment they were joined by the reserve under General Ripley.  Here the resistance was more obstinate, the work being exceedingly intricate, from the successive lines of entrenchments contrived with studied complexity;   a constant use of the bayonet was the only mode of assailing them; the enemy had, also, by this time, received considerable reinforecements.  General Miller continued to advance, although suffering severe loss in some of his valuable officers.  The twenty-first, under Lieutenant Colonel Upham, forming a part of the reserve, and a part of the 17th, uniting with the corps of General Miller, charged rapidly upon the remaining battery which was instantly abandoned by the British Infantry and artillery.

General Ripley now ordered a line to be formed, for the protection of the detachments engaged in destroying the batteries and was engaged in making arrangements for following up, against the rear of General Drummond, the success which had so far transcended expectations, when he received a wound in the neck and fell by the side of Major Brooks; he was immediately transported to the fort.

The object of the sortie having been completely effected, General Miller called his detachments and retired in good order with the prisoners and the trophies of this signal exploit.

During the engagement General Porter who commanded the riflemen and Indians, on the right of the left wing was taken prisoner by the enemy, whom, I, then acting as orderly sergeant, with a small force, retook, together with several British officers and soldiers, before they had time to retreat to their camp.  We then took up our line of march to Chipewa and had a small skirmish with the enemy and lost a few of our men, from thence we crossed the Niagara River and marched to Sackett’s Harbor by way of Black Rock, where I remained till the 23rd of May 1815, when I was discharged from the army and on the 24th started for Sangerfield, Oneida County, New York and arrived there about the 30th day of May and there remained about one year, and then removed to Georgetown, Casinova County, New York, remained there several months, thence to Wolcott, New York, Seneca County, and remained there about one year, from thence to Springfield, Erie County, Pennsylvannia, where I became acquainted with Anna Barnes, daughter of Abijah and Aby Barnes and on the 29th day of April 1819 was married to her, and in December following, removed to Coneaught, Erie County, Pennsylvania.

On the 4th day of August 1828 I was elected Second Lieutenant and on the 7th day of April 1832 was elected First Lieutenant and on the 2nd day of march 1834 was elected Captain of the “Lexington Light Infantry” attached to the first Battalion of Erie County volunteers of Pennsylvania.

In the year 1837 I removed to Coneaught, Astabulia County, Ohio in the month of April and removed from thence to Kirtland, Ohio in August following and was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, on the 28th day of April 1838 by Elder Elijah Cheney, and on the 4th day of November following I left there for Caldwell County, Missouri with the expectation of permanently settling myself there with the [same] and came as far as Springfield, Illinois (December 12th) and there settled, the brethren being driven out of the State of Missouri under the exterminating order of Governor Boggs and from thence I removed to Nauvoo where I arrived about the fourth day of October [1841]was there ordained a Priest by Elder William Marks, and received a license as such December 29th 1841.  One the 2nd day of April 1842 was elected Major of the Second Battalion, Fourth regiment, Second Cohort, Nauvoo Legion.  On the 6th day of the same month was ordained an Elder by Elder Lyman Wight.  One the 15th day of September 1844 was elected Colonel of the aforesaid Regiment to fill the vacancy of Colonel J. Dunham who had been promoted.  One the 8th day of October following was ordained under the hands of President Brigham Young and Amasa Lyman into the Eleventh Quorum of Seventies as one of the Seven Presidents of the same, and being the oldest one of said Presidents, presided as Senior President of the said Quorum at the organization of the same.  
	
In the fall of 1842 my brother Alpheus and nephew was called on a mission to Wisconsin during the winter.  My brother started for home and perished in a severe storm between Carthage and Nauvoo.  Hearing the news of his death, I returned to Nauvoo.  Acted as Sergeant of the police from 1845 until the Exodus of the Saints from Nauvoo.  I had command of the Police while destroying the printing press that published the paper called the Nauvoo Expositor, which was declared a nuisance by the City Council.

I was taken with a writ the same time that the Prophet Joseph was to Carthage when we gave bail to the next erm of Court.  The Prophet was taken with another writ and placed in jail where he was martyred.  Had charge of finishing the work on the temple at Nauvoo.  Left Nauvoo in June 1846, arrived on Missouri River opposite Winter Quarters in November.  In January 1847 my wife and daughter died from exposure.  In 1848 came to Salt Lake Valley with the rest of my family.  Arrived in Salt Lake in the fall of 1848.  Was the first Alderman elected in G. S. L. City and held said office till 1861.  Was called on mission to Southern Utah in 1861.  Resided there until 1866.  I then removed to Holden, Millard County.  I commenced to receive a pension in 1873 for my service in the War of 1812.  My son Appleton died February 26th 1877.  

Jesse Perse Harmon died December 24th 1877 aged 82 years 4th months and thirteen days.  He lived and died a faithful Latter-day Saint – was only sick 24 hours.

Biography of Jacob Foutz Sr. and Margaret Mann Foutz
--- by Grace Foutz Boulter and Mary Foutz Corrigan

Jacob Foutz Sr. was a native of Pennsylvania.  He was born in Franklin County, Nov. 20, 1800, the son of John Foutz and Elizabeth Hinkle, who were also natives of this same county and state. 

The information available regarding the earlier ancestry of this family is meager.  It is known, however, that the father of the above mentioned John Foutz was Conrad Foutz, born in Sweibruchen, Germany in 1734, died in Donegal, Pa. Nov. 20, 1790.   Conrad’s wife, Elizabeth, was born in 1739, place unknown.  She died Sept. 26, 1827, at Lewisburg, Pa.

According to the records of Mr. A.B. Boutz, who lived in Pennsylvania, and who died about 1937, the above mentioned Conrad Foutz came to this country from Germany.  His father and mother died during the trip over and were buried at sea.  Conrad came to America alone, but no record is available as to the year he came.

It is believed that Jacob Foutz Sr. had several brothers and sisters.  The only authentic record we have as yet is a mention made in the diary of Jacob Foutz Sr. where he writes of having a brother, Micial, and a sister, Elizabeth.  The record of his sister, Elizabeth, shows she was born June 22, 1797, Franklin County, Pa.  She married Jacob Hess, 1816.  Elizabeth Foutz Hess joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and came to Utah with the Pioneers in 1847.  She was the mother of twelve children.  She made her home in Farmington, Utah.  Her posterity is numerous throughout northern Utah.

Very little information is to be had regarding the early life of Jacob Foutz Sr.  We do know, however, that he was an energetic brick layer.  When he was twenty-one years old (July 22, 1822) he married Mararet Mann (or Munn).  She was the daughter of David Mann and Mary Rock, born Dec. 11, 1801 in Thomastown, Franklin County, Pa.  When Margaret was a mere baby she was left an orphan, deprived of both parents.  But He who is a “Father to the fatherless” had a mission for her to perform and so she was spared and brought up by strangers to heed the voice of God and glorify His name. 
The lives of these two young people, Jacob and Margaret, were destined to be adventuresome and notable.  They lived in one of the most progressive periods the world has ever known and in one of the countries which was making its own early history at this time.  They came from a section of this country that furnished many pioneers and early in their married life they too went to live on the frontier.  

While they lived in Franklin County, Pa. four girls were born to them, two of which died in infancy.  Susan was born Feb. 14, 1823, and Polly was born Oct. 10, 1824.  Polly lived to be about seven years old, as it is believed she died sometime in 1831.  The third daughter, Nancy Ann, was born in Jemper City, Franklin, Pa., on the 21st day of May, 1826.  The fourth child, Elizabeth, was born Sept. 13, 1827.  

Franklin County, where the Foutz family lived, was settled mainly by German people, and the Foutz children were taught to speak the German language before they learned to speak English.  This caused them much embarrassment when they left this section of the country and went west among the English speaking people. 

In the latter part of the year 1827, the family moved west to Richland County, Ohio.  At this time Ohio and the country westward was only sparsely settled.  The small settlements were chiefly along the rivers which were the main means of travel.  There was much good land to be had for the taking and many families were leaving their homes in the east to take up farming on the western frontiers.  

It was in this new home in Richland County, Ohio, where the fifth child in the Foutz family was born.  This daughter they named Sarah.  Here also death visited this humble abode as Polly, their second daughter, died sometime in 1831.  In December of this same year, 1831, their sixth daughter was born to them on Christmas Day.  

While this little family lived in Richland County, Ohio, Elder David Evans of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came to their home and taught them the Gospel.  They were convinced of its truth and were baptized into the Church, which was a very unpopular thing to do at that time, as most people were very bitter toward the Elders.  

The same year they became members of the Church, their first son was born.  He was Alma, the seventh child in the family, born Dec. 4, 1824.  This child, however, like his sister Polly, was not permitted to live long upon the earth, as he died in childhood sometime before October, 1838.

Shortly after the Foutz family joined the Church, they probably felt the “spirit of gathering” which was then being taught by the Elders of the Church, for they left Ohio and moved farther west.  This time they purchased some land on the Crooked River in Missouri.   Here was an organized branch of the Church, and here they hoped to have a permanent home.  This branch of the Church was presided over by their friend, Elder David Evans, who had first preached the Gospel to them.  

Speaking of this new home in Missouri, Margaret Foutz says, “We enjoyed ourselves exceedingly well and everything seemed to prosper, but the spirit of persecution began to manifest itself.  Falsehoods were circulated about the Mormon population that was settling about the region and soon there began to be signs of trouble.”

Here, on the Crooked River in Caldwell County, Missouri, another son was born to the Foutz family Mar. 16, 1837.  This son they named Joseph Lehi.  He was the eldest son to live and was destined to play an important role in the settling of the west. Margaret Foutz, in October, 1838, speaks of her “little family of five children” so we take for granted that the eldest child, Susan, must also have passed on into another sphere before this time, as well as Polly and Alma. 

The Foutz family, with the other members of the little settlement, were not permitted to enjoy their new home for long.  The mobs were driving the Saints out of one county after another in Missouri, and as Margaret Foutz said, “Even in the little settlement of Haun’s Mill in Caldwell County, trouble was being felt.”

The mobs had threatened to destroy the mill owned by Brother Haun and so as a precautionary measure the Saints had organized themselves together and planned to keep a few watchmen at the mill continually.  

The Saints had met with a great deal of opposition from the people in Missouri, as they had in different sections of the east.  It seems the evil spirit was always at work stirring up individuals and groups of individuals to persecute the Saints.  Many times the brethren had tried to settle matters peaceably, but to no avail, and so in October, 1838, the Foutz family had a most trying experience.  It is known in Church History as “The Haun’s Mill Massacre.”

The following paragraphs are taken from the account of Joseph Young, an eye witness of one of the most awful scenes which ever stained the annals of history in any age or country.  His story coincides perfectly with the account which Margaret Foutz gave shortly before her death, which account will also be recorded here. 

Brother Young says: “On Sunday, October 28, we arrived at Haun’s Mill where we found a number of our friends collected, who were holding a council and deliberating upon the best course for them to pursue to defend themselves against the mob who were collecting in the neighborhood under the command of Colonel Jennings, of Livingston, and threatening them with house burning and killing.”

 “The decision of the council was that the neighborhood should put itself in a state of defense.  Accordingly, about twenty-eight of our men armed themselves and were in constant readiness for an attack, if any small body of mobbers might come upon them.  The same evening, for some reason best known to themselves, the mob sent one of their number to enter into a treaty with our friends, which was accepted on the condition that each party, as far as their influence extended, should exert themselves to prevent any further hostilities.  At this time, however, there was another mob collecting on Grand River at William Mann’s, which was threatening us; consequently, we remained under arms on Monday the 29th, which passed away without molestation from any quarter.”

 “On Tuesday, the 30th (Oct), that bloody tragedy was enacted, the scenes of which I shall never forget.  More than three-fourths of the day had passed in tranquility as smiling as the preceding one.  I think there was no individual of our company that was apprised of the sudden and awful fate which hung over our heads like an overwhelming torrent, and which was to change the prospects, the feeling and the sympathies of about thirty families.”

 “The banks of Shoal Creek, on either side, teemed with children sporting and playing, while their mothers were engaged in domestic employments.  Fathers or husbands were either on guard about the mills or other property, or employed in gathering crops for winter consumption.  The weather was very pleasant, the sun shone clearly, all was tranquil, and no one expressed any apprehension of the awful crisis that was near us, even at our doors.”

 “It was about four o’clock, P.M., while sitting in my cabin with my babe in my arms, and my wife standing by my side, the door being open, I cast my eyes on the opposite bank of Shoal Creek, and saw a large body of armed men on horses directing their course toward the mills with all possible speed.  As they advanced through the scattering trees that bordered the prairie they seemed to form themselves into a three square position, forming a vanguard in front.  At this moment, David Evans, seeing the superiority of their numbers (there being two hundred and forty of them according to their own count) gave a signal and cried for peace.  This not being heeded they continued to advance, and their leader, a man named Comstock, fired a gun, which was followed by a solemn pause of about ten or twelve seconds; when all at once they discharged about one hundred rifles, aiming at a blacksmith’s shop, into which our friends fled for safety.  They then charged up to the shop, the crevices of which, between the logs, were sufficiently large to enable them to aim directly at the bodies of those who had fled there for refuge from the fire of their murderers.  There were several families tented in the rear of the shop whose lives were exposed, and, amid showers of bullets, they fled to the weeds in different directions.”

 “After standing and gazing at this bloody scene for a number of minutes, and finding myself in the uttermost danger, the bullets having reached the house where I was living, I committed my family to the protection of Heaven, and leaving the house on the opposite side, I took a path which led up the hill, following in the trail of three of my brethren that had fled from the shop.”

 “While ascending the hill we were discovered by the mob, who immediately fired at us, and continued so to do ‘till we reached the summit.  In descending the hill, I secreted myself in a thicket of bushes, where I lay till eight o’clock in the evening.  At this time I heard a voice calling my name in an undertone.  I immediately left the thicket and went to the house of Benjamin Lewis, where I found my family- who had fled there in safety- and two of my friends mortally wounded; one of whom died before morning.  Here we passed the painful night in deep and awful reflections on the scenes of the preceding evening.  After daylight appeared some four or five men with myself, who had escaped with our lives from this horrid massacre, repaired as soon as possible to the mills to learn the condition of our friends whose fate we had but too truly anticipated.”

 “When we arrived at the house of Mr. Haun, we found Mr. Merrick’s body lying in the rear of the house, Mr. McBride’s in front, literally mangled from head to foot.  We were informed by Miss Rebecca Judd, who was an eye witness, that he was shot with his own gun after he had given it up, and then cut to pieces with a corn cutter by a man named Rogers, of Davis County, who keeps a ferry on Grand River, and who has since repeatedly boasted of this act of savage barbarity.  Mr. York’s body we found in the house.  After viewing these corpses we immediately went to the blacksmith’s shop, where we found nine of our friends, eight of whom were already dead – the other, Mr. Cox of Indiana, in agonies of death, who soon expired.”

 “We immediately prepared and carried them to the place of interment.  This last office of kindness due to the remains of departed friends was not attended with the customary ceremonies nor decency; for we were in jeopardy, every moment expecting to be fired on by the mob, who we supposed were lying in ambush, waiting the first opportunity to dispatch the remaining few who were providentially preserved from the slaughter of the preceding day.  However, we accomplished without molestation this painful task.  The place of burial was a vault in the ground, formerly intended for a well, into which we threw the bodies of our friends promiscuously.”
	
This was the scene as pictured by one of the surviving brethren and now we will tell it as Sister Margaret Foutz remembered it years later. 

Sister Foutz said the Saints had thought all was amicably adjusted after the meeting they had had with the mobbers the day before, and Brother Evans had gone to inform the brethren, her husband among them, that all was well.  It was about the middle of the afternoon of that day when all of a sudden, without any warning whatever, sixty or seventy men with blackened faces, came riding up, their horses at full speed.  The brethren ran for protection into an old log blacksmith’s shop.  Being without arms they were helpless when the mob rode up to the shop and without any explanation or apparent cause, began a wholesale butchery by firing round after round through the cracks in the log wall of the shop. 

Sister Margaret Foutz goes on to tell, “I was at home with my little family of five children and could hear the firing of guns.  In a moment I knew that the mob was upon us.  Soon a runner came telling the women and children to hasten into the woods and secret ourselves. This we did in all haste without taking anything to keep us warm; and had we been fleeing from the scalping knife of the Indian we would not have made greater haste.  As we ran from house to house, gathering as we went, we finally numbered about forty or fifty women and children.”

 “We ran about three miles into the woods and there huddled together, spreading what few blankets and shawls we chanced to have upon the ground for the children.  There we remained until two o’clock the next morning before we heard anything of the result of the firing at the mill.  Who can imagine our feelings during this dreadful suspense?  When the news did come, lo! What terrible news! Fathers, brothers, husbands killed!

 “We now took up the line of march for home, but alas what a home!  Who would we find there?  Now with our minds full of the most fearful forebodings, we retraced those three long, dreary miles.  As we were returning I saw Brother Myers who had been shot through the body.  In that dreadful state he had crawled on his hands and knees about two miles to his home.”

 “One the way to the mill, in the first house I came to, there were three dead men.   One, a Brother McBride, was a terrible sight to behold, having been cut and chopped and mangled with a corn cutter.  I was told he was a survivor of the Revolutionary War.”

 “After I arrived at my house with my children, I hastily made a fire to warm them and then started for the mill, about two miles distant.  My children would not remain at home as they said, ‘if father and mother are going to be killed, we want to be with them.’  I hurried on, looking for my husband and finally found him in an old house covered with some rubbish.  He had been shot in the thigh.  I there rendered him all the aid that I could, but it was evening before I could get him home.”

 “I saw thirteen more dead bodies at the shop and witnessed the beginning of the burial which consisted in throwing the men that the mob had killed into a vault that formerly was intended for a well.  They threw the bodies in head first or feet first as the case might be.  When they had thrown in three my heart sickened and I could not stand it more.  I turned away to keep from fainting.”

 “My husband and another brother had drawn dead bodies over themselves and pretended to be dead.  By so doing they saved their own lives and heard what some of the mob said.  After the firing was over two little boys that were in the shop begged for their lives, but no, one of the mob said, ‘they will make Mormons’ and he put the muzzle of his gun to the boys’ heads and blew their brains out.”

 “Oh, what a change one short day had brought!  Here were our friends dead and dying, one in particular asked me to take a hammer and give him relief by knocking his brains out, so great was his agony.  And in all this we knew not what moment our enemies would be upon us again.  All this suffering, not because we had broken any law – on the contrary, it was part of our religion to keep the laws of the land – but because the evil spirit was at work among the children of men.”

 “In the evening Brother Evans got a team and wagon and conveyed my husband to our home.  He carried him in and placed him on the bed.  I then had to attend him alone, without a doctor or anyone to tell me what to do for him.  Six days later my husband, himself, helped me to extract the bullet which was buried deep in the thick part of his thigh and was flattened like a knife.  We did this with a kitchen knife.”

 “During the first ten days the mob came every day with blackened faces (more like demons from the infernal pit than like human beings) cursing and swearing that they would kill the old Mormon preacher, who was my husband.  At times like these when human nature would quail, I have felt the power of God upon me to that degree that I have stood before the mob fearless and although a woman and alone, these demons in human shape had to succumb to the power which they knew not of.  During these days of danger I sometimes hid my husband out in the woods behind our home and covered him with leaves.  When he was able to sit up he was dressed as a woman and put at the spinning wheel.  In this way his life was protected.  Thus, during my husband’s illness was I harassed by mobocratic violence.”

The story is told that on one occasion when the mob came to Sister Foutz’s looking for her husband, she felt the power of God upon her to such an extent that she was totally unafraid.  She commanded the mobbers, inasmuch as they had killed and injured the men of the community, to kill and dress a pig for her and her little ones to eat.  These men trembled before this little woman and did as she had told them to do.  Sister Foutz often told how she surprised herself on such occasions, but she was humble and gave credit and thanks to her God for this extra courage and strength.  

The mobs had taken food, clothing and bedding from the Saints and had even burned some of their homes.  So now besides the pain and sorrow they had to bear, many of them were without even the bare necessities of life.

The day came, at length, when the mob finally left the Saints alone with the understanding that they were to leave Missouri in the spring.  This the Saints agreed to do, even though it meant giving up another of their homes and the improved land that went with them.  Always their enemies profited from their labor and suffering.  

About the middle of February, 1839, the Foutz family, along with other inhabitants of the little settlement of Haun’s Mill, and hundreds of other Saints from other parts of Missouri, began their exodus.  They went from Missouri to Quincy, Illinois.  

At Quincy the people were hospitable.  They understood the unjust treatment the Saints had been given in Missouri and for a while they seemed to sympathize with them.  As more Saints continued to come into Illinois the local citizens of Quincy became alarmed.  They feared that the new citizens would take all the work to be had and probably upset political authority and so they too began to suggest that the “Mormons” move elsewhere.

In the files of the Latter Day Saints, there is on record what seems to be a registered complaint signed by Jacob Foutz, sworn to against individuals of the mob which had molested the Saints in Missouri.  

This complaint reads as follows:

“Quincy, Illinois, March 17, A.D., 1840

This is to certify that I was a citizen retime of Caldwell County, Missouri, at the time Governor Bogg’s exterminating order was issued and that I was quartered on by the mob militia without my leave or consent, at different times, and one time by William Mann, Hiram Cumstock and brother, who professed to be the captain, also Robert White; And that I was wounded and driven from the State to my inconvenience and deprived of my freedom as well as to my loss of at least four hundred dollars.
					Signed __________ Jacob Joutz [Foutz]
	Sworn to before C. M. Woods, Clerk Circuit.”

Many such complaints were sworn to by different men and they are on file in Illinois, but, although the matter was even taken to the Federal Government at Washington, D. C., the Saints were unable to get help or redress for the sufferings and material losses which the citizens and Governor of Missouri had caused them.

It must have been sometime in 1840 when the Foutz family left Quincy, Ill. for in that year (Oct. 27, 1840) we find Jacob Foutz was made second counselor to Bishop Matthew Leach in the Freedom Stake of the Church, near Payson, Adams Co. Ill.  While the Foutz family lived in Adams County, Ill., probably in the city of Quincy, or near Payson, their daughter, Margaret, was born.  This was on the 16th day of October 1839.

Sometime between Oct. 1840 and Feb. 1841, the Foutz family moved into Brown Co., for it is recorded in the writings of Joseph Smith that Feb. 28, 1841 a branch of the Church, or Stake of Zion, was organized in Brown Co., western Ill. with Levi Gifford as president, Lodarick as first counselor and Jacob Foutz as second counselor. 

Jacob Foutz must not have lived in this locality long, for shortly after this he was living in Nauvoo, Ill.  On the 20th of Oct. 1842, the High Council in session (at Nauvoo) “Resolved that the City of Nauvoo be divided into ten wards according to the division made by the Temple Committee, and that there be a Bishop appointed over such districts immediately out of the city and adjoining thereto as shall be considered necessary.”  This resolution goes on further to give the names of those chosen to preside over these districts.  Jacob Foutz was appointed Bishop of the Fifth Ward. 

In a little diary kept by Jacob Foutz, we are given a little insight into his life.  This book is a meager affair, hand made of white paper, sewed to a black cover.  In this diary he says, “Left Nauvoo 12th of September and left Quincy 3rd of October.”  This we believe to be the notation made at the time he left for the missionfield.  The year is believed to be 1841.

The Church Presidency thought it advisable to keep in touch with the eastern branches even if the Saints were hard pressed in their new location.  Missionaries were sent out as usual in spite of the fact that they were badly needed at home to drain the swamp that was to be there home, build their homes and help with the erection of the Temple.

Under just what circumstances Jacob Foutz left to go on his mission, we do not know, but surely it must have been a great sacrifice for him and his family to make.  They were barely settled in their home in Nauvoo when he was sent away, leaving his six children and wife who was expecting another baby soon.  His mission took him again to his old home state of Pennsylvania where he labored among his friends and relatives, many of whom he was successful in converting and baptizing into the Church.  

Jacob Foutz tells (in his diary) of leaving “Pitsburg” and going out and searching faithfully and preaching in nearby neighborhoods.  He labored in Indiana, Camberg, Bedford, and Franklin counties.  Most of the time he preached at meetings held in the school houses, but occasionally meetings were held in the homes of individuals.  According to his record, the investigators of these meetings numbered from eleven to eighteen and at one meeting he notes twenty-eight were present.  Nov. 16, 1842, Jacob Foutz records that he baptized Levi Thornton and wife, Elizabeth.  An expense account in the diary which he kept right along with his other records, is interesting when we compare the price and variety of goods which this missionary bought with those purchased today.  Evidently these good brethren bought for their families as well as themselves while out in the missionfield, as such items as “calico” appear often in the lists, one of which is as follows: 10 lbs. fish .40, sugar .10, calico 1.60, cofy .12 and butter 2 lbs. .20.

Just how long Bro. Foutz remained on his mission is not known.  The next account of him we have is in June 18..., at which time he was again in Nauvoo.  His wife had given birth to a baby boy in his absence.  This child, Hyrum, was born in Dec. 1842 at Nauvoo, Ill.  No record, after this time, is to be had concerning this baby, so it is believed it died in infancy.  Nauvoo at that time was a most unhealthful place to live.  There was much sickness throughout the settlement and old and young died of fever continually.  It is possible that little Hyrum may have been a victim of some such disease.  Our sympathy goes out to the mother of this family, for she had more than her share of work and worry to make a home in this new country under such trying circumstances.

In Margaret Foutz’s autobiography (written years later) she had this to say: “My husband was a man of great faith, and many times had sickness yielded and even broken bones been united in our family, through prayer and the administration of the laying on of hands.  I bear testimony that this work commonly called ‘Mormonism’ is true and I leave this as a testimony to my children and to my children’s children, and to all who may read my autobiography, that this work is the work of the Lord.”

 “I will now chronicle one miracle that took place in my home.  My husband took very sick, also a young man that lived at our house was very sick and my eldest child had been very sick for about ten days; in fact he was so bad that he had become speechless.  I sent for an Elder, Bro. J. Carto.  He and another Elder came with him, and they administered to each of the sick and then called upon them, in the name of the Lord, to arise from their beds and be made whole.  They did so and I got them something to eat, of which they partook and they were instantaneously healed by the power of God – His servants officiating in the Priesthood which they had received.”

After returning from his mission, Jacob Foutz was very active in the Church and he was also made a member of the Nauvoo Legion.  Inasmuch as threats were being made by mobs to take the Prophet and others out of Nauvoo, men were called especially to protect Bro. Joseph. Jacob was among a group of about eighty-five men aboard the “Maid of Iowa”, a steamboat, which was sent out from Nauvoo to patrol the Mississippi River in an effort to prevent anyone from taking the Prophet to Missouri by water for trial.  This boat was loaded June 25, 1842 and sailed that night.  They were out about one week, as it is recorded they left Quincy, Ill. July 1, 1843 at 8 o’clock a.m. to return to Nauvoo.

On Sunday, Oct. 1, 1843, Joseph Smith attended a meeting in Nauvoo in the morning which was adjourned in consequence of cold and rain.  The weather in the afternoon was more pleasant and the people assembled to resume their meeting.  The were addressed on this occasion by Elder William Marks, local president of the Nauvoo Stake, Charles C. Rich and Bishop Jacob Foutz.

The Foutz family, like all of the other Saints, were busy making their home in Nauvoo while, at the same time, they lived in constant fear of the mobs which were threatening them continually.  In June 1844, the Prophet Joseph, his brother, Hyrum, and others, following the advice of some of the Saints, gave themselves up to the mob in an effort to save trouble and bloodshed.  These men were taken to the jail in Carthage, Ill. from which the Prophet and his brother, Hyrum, never returned alive.  After this dreadful event, which took place at Carthage, in which the two brothers, Joseph and Hyrum, lost their lives, the Saints lived in even greater fear and anxiety.  Threats were made continually by the mob to burn Nauvoo and drive the people from the state.  In these troublesome and uncertain times, Margaret Foutz gave birth to another son, Jacob, on the 25th of August, 1844.

The Saints, now left without a president, were greatly bewildered.  Sidney Rigdon, who had been a counselor to Joseph Smith in the First Presidency of the Church, sought to set himself up as their leader.  This he did before the Twelve Apostles, the rightful governing power of the Church, could gather themselves inform their various missionfields.  Sidney Rigdon was prevented from carrying out his plan and was later disfellowshipped from the Church.  Many were led away who were in sympathy with his views.  Several other Church leaders broke away from the Church at this time and took with them many followers.  Jacob Foutz and his family remained faithful to the proper authority and when Brigham Young, president of the Twelve Apostles, was chosen to lead the Church, they rallied around their new president and gave him their support.

In the fall the general conference of the Church was held.  At his conference, Oct. 7, 1844 Jacob Foutz and other leaders and Bishops were sustained in their various offices by a unanimous vote.  On Oct. 8, 1844, at another session of this general conference, Pres. Young proceeded to select men from the High Priest Quorum to go abroad “in all the congressional districts of the U. S. to preside over the branches of the Church.”  Jacob Foutz was among those chosen on this occasion.

It seems that there was much unrest and many evil practices which had crept into the eastern branches of the Church and Pres. Young thought it advisable to send faithful men, whom he knew to have the spirit of God with them, to preside over these branches and straighten out matters.  Many men left Nauvoo shortly after they received their call to fill this mission.  There is no record, however, the Bro. Foutz answered this call.  He had recently been on a mission to Pennsylvania and it is possible that he was not sent out again, his health being poor since his encounter with the mob at Haun’s Mill.

Although persecution was great and it was felt generally that the Saints would again have to abandon their homes, they were commanded of God to go ahead with the building of a Temple.  All who could, gave of their time and means for this purpose.  At the beginning of the new year special efforts were put forth to rush the Temple to completion.  In a record published by Bishops Whitney and Miller, trustees in trust for the Church, dated Jan. 31, 1845, it is shown that Jacob Foutz was one of the brethren appointed as agents by the proper authorities of the Church to “collect donations and tithing for the Temple and for other purposes, in the City of Nauvoo.”

Three months later at the General Conference of the Church, on Apr. 7, 1845, William Clayton recorded the principal officers of the Church who were sustained by the Church membership.  On this occasion Jacob Foutz was sanctioned as Bishop of the Eight Ward of Nauvoo.

The winters were long and cold for those who were so poorly housed and underfed.  Sickness was prevalent and the Elders of the Church were kept busy administering to the sick and caring for their own families.

On Monday, Feb. 9, 1846, the Temple was seen to be on fire.  Men and women, carrying water frantically, succeeded in putting out the flames.  It was with sorrow they viewed the damage that had been done to the Lord’s House.  The structure which many had gone hungry to build.

When spring finally came again, life became more normal and the Foutz family made preparations for the wedding of their next eldest daughter, Elizabeth.  On Apr. 10, 1846, Elizabeth was married to Henson Walker Jr. in the Nauvoo Temple.

This young couple began their wedded life in troublesome times.  The members of the Church were moving across the river and leaving Nauvoo as rapidly as possible.  Many had moved during the dead of winter and those still in the city were urged to speed their departure.  Pres. Young and many of the Twelve Apostles were already as far west as Council Bluffs in search of a place of refuge for the Saints.  So Elizabeth and Henson Walker, eager to make a home for themselves, had no idea where this home might one day be.

Among those first to leave Nauvoo, crossing the Mississippi River on the ice, was Elizabeth Foutz Hess, sister of Bishop Jacob Foutz.  Elizabeth’s husband, Jacob Hess, was at that time paralyzed.  They suffered greatly from cold and exposure.  The first night after leaving Nauvoo they camped on the Iowa side of the river in a cold rain.  From here they went on to Mt. Pisgah in the state of Iowa.  They encountered hardships and trouble throughout the journey and upon their arrival at Mt. Pisgah, Elizabeth’s husband was far spent.  Her son, John W. Hess, had assumed the responsibility of his father’s family as well as his own.  He made his father as comfortable as possible in one of the two wagons and in the other was carried all the household supplies and provisions the oxen team could draw.  All able to walk were forced to do so.  At Mt. Pisgah they prepared to stay for a while.  Here the earlier pioneers had planted crops for the benefit of those who would follow, and it was thought this would be good place to rest.  They were not there long until Jacob Hess died, June 1846.

It is not known definitely just when Bishop Foutz and his family left Nauvoo, but it must have been soon after their daughter, Elizabeth’s marriage to Henson Walker on Apr. 10, 1846, for trouble with the mob became worse each day.   It is recorded that few Saints were left in Nauvoo after Aug. 1846, for on the 12th of this month the mob, about twelve hundred in number, came upon the Saints, armed with cannon and guns, and had a terrible battle.  After fighting one hour and twenty-five minutes, the mob offered terms of compromise.  All Mormons were to leave the city within five days, leaving only twelve families to finish the unsettled business and dispose of property, etc.  The brethren, having little or no choice, consented to these terms and they hurried preparations to leave.  It is said that on Thursday, five days later, when the mob came to Nauvoo some fifteen hundred in number, such was the distress and suffering of the Saints as actually to draw tears from the mob.  Thus it was the “City Beautiful” was left behind and the Saints again were made homeless.

On leaving Nauvoo, the Foutz family went first to Garden Grove, Iowa.  Here they stayed long enough to harvest a crop (summer and fall of 1846), they they moved on the Winter Quarters.  Here the Saints had built some homes and were preparing to spend the winter.  Many, arriving late, were forced to live in their wagons throughout the long, cold winter.

All during the fall and winter reports came at different times and from various sources that the mob in Missouri was organizing to come against the Saints in their new location.  It seemed that as yet they had not found the place which was destined to be their peaceful home.  Often the Saints sang together the hymn, “All Is Well”, written by Brother William Clayton.  This helped t keep up their courage and strengthen their faith that eventually they would “find the place which God for them prepared, far away in the West.”

In the spring of 1847, Pres. Young and the Twelve Apostles organized a company of pioneers to blaze a trail westward and search out a suitable place for the Saints to settle.  On the 14th of April this little band set forth.  There were one hundred forty-three men and boys on the lists of this company, three women and two children.  They had seventy-three wagons with horses, oxen and cattle.

Among this group was Henson Walker Jr. the young husband of Elizabeth Foutz.  When Henson was called to take this journey, his wife was very ill.  He would have declined to go had not Elizabeth urged him on.  She wanted him to respond to all calls made upon him by the Presidency and would not now consent to his staying with her.  So Henson left with the promise that if his wife lived, she would follow him later.

Elizabeth was determined to keep this promise, so preparations were made for her to make the trip with one of the first companies to leave after the original company was well on its way.   She planned to travel with her husband’s people.  When her own folks learned that she was going, they prepared to follow that they might look after her burial.  They had no hope that she would live to see the valleys of the Rocky Mountains.  However, as they moved on westward, out of the damp lowlands, Elizabeth’s health began to improve.  Her life, which for a time seemed to be close to the end, had in reality only begun.

It was on the 21st of June, 1847, that the Foutz family left Winter Quarters on the journey that was eventually to take them to a permanent home in the mountains.  These pioneers were organized into companies with a captain over each hundred, one over each fifty and one over each ten.  This was done that each family might know where it was to travel and to whom to look for counsel and help.  Bishop Jacob Foutz and Joseph Horne were captains of the second fifty of the Abraham O. Smoot Co.

As near as we are now able to figure, there were in the Foutz family at this time Bishop Jacob Foutz, who was forty-six years old, his wife, Margaret, forty-five years old, their daughters, Nancy Ann, twenty-one years old, Elizabeth, who was nineteen, Catherine, fifteen years old, a son, Joseph Lehi, ten years old, a daughter, Margaret, seven years old, and another son, Jacob Jr. who was four years old before they reached their destination.

The family very likely had two wagons in which to store all their household goods and provisions, as Catherine and Lehi often told how they drove one of the teams of oxen on their journey westward.  Even thought they were better off in this respect than many families, the individuals in the family had t walk most of the way.

This journey offered a variety of experiences.  Before they reached their destination there was happiness, romance and adventure in store for them, as well as fatigue, hunger and sorrow.  They were to find out what it meant to toil on in intense heat, extreme cold and rain.  In the end lay the reward, worth all it cost.

When they made preparations for the journey, they had thought to supply themselves with all that was necessary for their comfort on the journey, but they soon learned that the wagon would not hold a great deal.  Often, by planning and careful packing, they were able to get in a few luxuries as well as the bare necessities, only to find out that it was too much of a load for the oxen to pull.  When most families were on the road, they had only the essential food, clothing and bedding, and these were not enough when misfortune came their way.
	
Sometimes the rain came through the wagon-cover and soaked the flour which mildewed and was not fit to be eaten.  Thereafter the family lived almost entirely on buffalo meat.  At times a wagon would be over turned while fording a stream and then the entire contents of the wagon would be lost or badly spoiled.  Feed for the cattle became a problem.  In many places the grass had either been eaten off by the animals of the earlier companies or destroyed when some traveler had left his campfire and caused the prairie to burn.  Each day they tried to travel from one watering place to another, but this was not always possible as the streams dried up late in the summer and so occasionally they were without water.  The hot, dry plains brought health to some who had fallen sick in the low, damp city of Nauvoo, but others became ill from the changes in climate, water and food.  The mothers, with small children, suffered greatly with anxiety, never knowing what would be their lot from day to day.  Often they left a lonely grave along the wayside, one that was not likely to ever be visited again.

The Indians too were ever a source of worry.  They were not hostile and so the pioneers did not fear them, but they were cattle thieves of the worst kind. Each night guards had to be set about the camp to keep track of the animals that wandered away in search of food.  May companies did not have enough oxen and horses to draw their wagons and so could ill afford to lose any to the Indians.  However, in the face of all the trouble they had to overcome, there was ever some fun.  Each day brought a change of scenery, new hoe and greater dreams.  Often in the evening they gathered around the campfire and listened to talks from hunters and explorers who sometimes spent the night with them.  Or they sang songs and danced when they were not too tired.  The young folks, upon whom responsibility did not weigh too heavily, rejoiced in the friendships they made and the adventures they encountered.

Brigham Young and the first company of pioneers had at last arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, July 24, 1847.  They found it to be a good place and most of them were well satisfied with the prospects of the country.  They were thankful and rejoiced in then blessings they had on their journey.  Not a man, woman or child had died on the trip and not even any cattle died, but a few were stolen by the Indians.

This group of Pioneers immediately got to work exploring the country thereabout and laying out the city that was to be their future home.  Everything was to center around the Temple Square, and the city was so laid out.  The once barren desert at once became a very busy place.  Some were sent into the mountains for logs with which to build homes, some set to work making adobes.  Some fenced off corrals for the cattle and others plowed the ground and planted crops.  Everyone did his part to get the valley ready for those who were soon to arrive.

On July 29th the Pueblo Company of the Mormon Battalion arrived in the Salt Lake Valley.  Everyone rejoiced in seeing the brethren who had answered the nation’s call and taken such a hard journey in to the wilderness.  These soldiers were in good spirits, but many were seriously ill and travel worn.  Those able to work assisted the Pioneers in the work being done in the valley, but they were all anxious to start east and look after their families.

As soon as it was possible, preparations were made for those who were going back to Winter Quarters to do so, as they hoped to reach their old homes before snow fell.  Accordingly, on Aug. 16, 1847, many of these hardy pioneers and soldiers set out again over the rough roads they had made.  Some were happy at the prospects of seeing their families, while others, like Henson Walker, were fearful lest their loved ones had departed this life.

On the 30th day of August these brethren met the Spencer Company on the 
Sweetwater – east of Ft. Bridger.  William Walker was in this group and it is believed that Elizabeth Foutz Walker was there also.  There must have been great rejoicing when this young couple, Elizabeth and Henson, were again united.  The Walker’s and Foutz’s went on to the Salt Lake Valley, arriving there in September, 1847.

Quotations taken from the Pioneer History Journal, compiled by Andrew Jenson, give a little insight into the whereabouts of the Foutz family in the fall of 1847.  “Sept. 7, 1847.  It snowed part of the day and the weather was cold.  By night the snow had cleared away.  They crossed the Dry Sandy Creek at 2 p.m. and the Little Sandy at 10 o’clock in the evening where they stopped to camp.  The road was good and the cattle traveled very much faster, especially after sundown. They made 28 miles that day.  The second fifty of Smoot’s hundred, with Jacob Foutz and Joseph Horne as captains, spent part of the day with other pioneers from another company at the upper crossing of the Sweetwater.”  “Sat, Sept. 18, 1847.  Smoot’s hundred arrived and camped on Bear River.”

And so their journey continued until the whole company arrived in the Salt Lake Valley Sept. 25, 1847.  This company was fortunate in getting their before the heavy snows fell.  Some companies caught in these storms suffered terribly.  The cattle could no longer pull the loads in the heavy snow and a call for help came to the Saints in the valley.  Quoting from the Pioneer History Journal, we find:  “The second fifty of Smoot’s company responded liberally to the call of sending teams from the valley to help the rear company over the mountains.  Jacob Foutz sent one yoke of oxen back.”

With winter ready to set in, the entire Foutz family became very busy establishing their new home.  With the other Saints they assisted in making the first improvements in Salt Lake City, along with working in the first organizations of the Church that were set up in this new location.

On November 7, 1847, Bishop Jacob Foutz was again placed at the head of one of the wards of the Church.  This time he became Bishop of the east half of the New Fort Ward, which was one of the five wards into which the Pioneers of Great Salt Lake Valley were divided.  This ward was located in the west side of town near where the Pioneer Park was later developed.  It was in this general location where the Foutz family located.  In this new home, Jan. 7, 1848, a baby daughter was born, whom they named Maranda.

Bishop Foutz had poor health and was in bed much of his time.  His ill health was contributed to by the injuries he received at Haun’s Mill and to the fever-sickness which he suffered while in Nauvoo.  Of this sickness his wife tells us more in her later years.  Just a little over a month after the arrival of the baby girl, which was their twelfth child, Bishop Jacob Foutz passed away.  His death occurred while he was away from home excavating in gravel, Feb 14, 1848.  His fellow workers said he took what they called a stroke and died suddenly.  (More like a heart attack).

It is not known where Bishop Jacob Foutz was buried.  There is no record to indicate that the City Cemetery had been laid out then, as his death was among the first to occur in the valley.  He was very likely buried on the family property, as there are records to indicate that such was the practice in that early day.

Although we do not know where his final resting place was, we do know that he went to the reward for which he had labored all his life.  His life had been an eventful one, mingled with joys and sorrows.  He had been a faithful member of the Church for many years and a diligent worker in it.  The Church leaders, a well as the membership, joined with the family in mourning the passing of this humble servant of God.

				Margaret Mann Foutz

Margaret Mann (or Munn?) Foutz was born in Thomastown, Franklin, Co., Pa, Dec. 11, 1801.  Her parents, David Mann (or Munn?) and Mary Rock, had twelve children.  (Only five children are listed on our family group sheet)  Her father died when she was four years old, leaving her mother with six boys and five girls; one child died in infancy.  Seven years later the mother died, and the following year Margaret was taken into the home and into the hearts of Daniel and Ann Borier. They were kind, religious people and were Protestants.

The Borier’s kept a tavern.  They had a son who devotedly loved their foster daughter and wished to make her his wife.  So pure and unselfish was their love for Margaret that they refused their consent because they felt their son was not worthy of this girl, who they loved and treated as their own daughter.

Margaret was blessed with wonderful health and delighted to pay her foster parents with service.  She milked cows, churned, washed dishes, went to market, and often got out of bed at midnight to prepare a meal for some delayed traveler.  She could not remember that she ever was tired.

This kind couple provided for her education in the best way they could.  There was a little log schoolhouse near, with a German teacher.  The only study was reading the German language, which was spoken exclusively in her home.  “Our teacher, “she said, “was a quiet man.  He would march us up in front by rapping on the table with a stick.  When through, we would take our seats.”

When Margaret was fourteen years old she was a woman of responsibility, and was destined to soon meet her future husband.  To their home on day came a fine looking young man of fair complexion to borrow an auger.  So impressed was she with his looks and personality that she inquired his name.  It was Jacob Foutz, who was of German descent.  “Right then,” said Margaret, “I decided that he was the man I wanted to marry.”  After a smooth sailing courtship of five years, they were married July 22, 1822 (or 1819?), by a priest in Greencastle, and went to housekeeping in their brother-in-law’s house.

The young husband was a bricklayer by trade and made a good living.  They moved from Pennsylvania to Star County, Ohio, where they lived for several years.

Until this time, Margaret had never joined any church.  Here in Ohio they both became Methodists.  They traveled by ox-team to Richland County in the same state, hoping to better their condition.  Soon after arriving in Richland County, Jacob was away attending a two-day Methodist revival and while he was gone, two men called at their home saying they were preachers of the Gospel.  They asked if they might stay all night.  Margaret directed them to their neighbors, although she knew they had no more room than they had.  But they night she attended their meeting and said she did not believe a word they said.

Her husband returned the next day and they both attended the meeting that evening and listened to Elders Derby and Tripple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  “My husband,” said Margaret, “returned home that evening a believer in this new religion in spite of the fact that he had just returned the day before from the Methodist revival, and he said, ‘This is just what I have been looking for.’  The following day he was baptized into the Church.  I called him ‘green’ then, but a month later, I too recognized the truth and joined the Church.”

Jacob Foutz was soon called to preside over the branch of the Church there.  He had a throat or lung infection and it had reached the stage where he could not speak above a whisper but he said, “If the Lord wants me to preside He will restore my health,” and he was administered to by the Elders and made whole immediately.

Said Margaret, “The following summer we moved to Missouri to join the other Saints and we bought land on Crooked River, and while here my husband was chosen with a few others to guard Brother Haun’s mill, as mob had threatened to destroy it.”

There is quoted here some incidents relating to the Haun’s Mill Massacre – recorded late in life as she recalled them, most of which are in addition to those given in Jacob’s Biography.

One afternoon a mob of sixty or seventy men came, their faces were blackened and they were riding at full speed.  Margaret was on her way to get a pail of water when the mob spied her and began shooting.  She threw herself behind a large fallen tree and lay there unhurt until they left, boasting “there is one woman less.”

When Margaret returned to her home and five children, her son came and told her to run for her life to the woods.  Later, twenty-eight bullets were cut out of the log where she had first fallen, and many more were picked up from the ground where she had fallen.  All that night she, with some forty of fifty women and children huddled together in the woods with a few shawls and blankets.

In the morning Margaret walked to the mill (some two or three miles distance) to look for her husband, not knowing whether he was dead or alive.  She found him covered with some rubbish.  He had been shot in the thigh and had saved himself by drawing dead bodies over him and pretending to be dead.  She saw the bodies that covered him and the others killed in the area.buried in the old dry well.

That evening Brother Evans got a team and took her and her husband home.  No one can understand the joyful sensation created by such a reunion except those who have been in like circumstances.  The mob thought they had taken her husband’s life, and she was forced to take him to the woods many times after that and cover him with leaves.

A miracle happened at the time of the Haun’s Mill massacre.  Isaac Laney, one of the Saints guarding with Jacob Foutz, fled from the scene as they poured a shower of lead after him which pierced his body.  Eleven bullets went through him.  There were twenty seven bullet holes in his shirt, seven in his pantaloons, and his coat was literally cut to pieces.  One ball entered one armpit and came out the other.  Another entered his back and came out at the breast.  A ball passed through each hip, each leg and each arm.  All these shots were received while he was running for his life, and strange as it may appear, although he had one of his ribs broken he was able to out-run his enemies and his life was saved.  We can only acknowledge this deliverance as a testimony of God’s power and mercy.

President Brigham Young was also among the number, and although the balls flew around him like hail, he was not wounded.

While in Missouri, Susan, the eldest child, was very sick with a fever.  She had been speechless for twenty-four hours.  The Prophet Joseph was traveling through the country and stopped a half mile from their home.  They sent for him and he sent two of the brethren in his stead.  They knelt down and prayed, and then administered to her.  The next morning Susan got up and ate her breakfast, and that same morning the Prophet called at their home and shook hands with everyone and said, “I knew she would be all right this morning.”

In February 1839 the Saints were driven by the mobs from Missouri.  They took refuge in Illinois and Iowa.  Margaret’s husband, Jacob, in the Nauvoo area successively served as a Bishop’s Counselor, Bishop of the Nauvoo Fifth and Eighth Wards.  He was a Bishop when the Saints were driven from Nauvoo.

 “I received my endowments and second anointings in the Nauvoo Temple, “Margaret tells us.

Jacob Foutz was a captain of the second fifty in his company in crossing the plains which started in June 1847 from Winter Quarters.  They arrived in Salt Lake City Sept. 25, 1847.  Margaret and her husband worked hard to get settled in this new land.  Jacob worked long hours in building their adobe house – hauling logs and sawing them into flooring with hand saws.  He had never fully recovered from the wound he received at Haun’s Mill, and with the hardships in crossing the plains, his life was shortened.  Five months after arriving in Salt Lake City he passed away, leaving is wife and children, the youngest but five weeks old.  Jacob was Bishop of his ward in Salt Lake City until his death.  Their earthly possessions besides the adobe house, consisted of seven bushiels of wheat, two cows, one city lot, and five acres of sagebrush land.  Their children were: Susan, Pollyanne, Nancy Ann, Elisabeth, Sarah, Catherine, Alma, Joseph, Lehi, Margaret, Hyrum, Jacob Jr. and Maranda.  Of these twelve children, five died without raising families.  Susan died after being healed in Missouri but before the trek west; Pollyanne at seven years passed away in Ohio; Alma and Hyrum died very young; and Sarah probably died before the trek as she is not listed with the Pioneers.  (Although Margaret speaks in one biography as being a widow and eight children which would have to include Sarah?)   The rest of the children, seven, all grew to manhood and womanhood, raised a numerous posterity which is scattered from Canada to Mexico, and as far as we know, they all belong to the Church of their parents. 

Joseph Lehi Foutz, the eldest son living at the time of his father’s death, even though only ten years of age, heroically shared the responsibility with his mother in caring for the family.

In March 1852 Margaret moved with her family to Pleasant Grove, Utah.  They first located on the land where the J. P. Hayes home now stands (!937).  Later they moved into a log cabin on the lot where the old Foutz home stood for many years.  This was on the northwest corner of First West and Center Streets.  At that time there was a rock wall around the city, forming a fort.  This wall bordered the north side of the Foutz property.

Feb. 20, 1882, George S. Clark, first Bishop of Pleasant Grove, wrote to the Deseret News: “We have only five spinning wheels at present in operation, but hope soon to have many more so that we can have some of the best music in our domestic circles.”  Margaret, it seems had one of these five wheels and together with her daughter, Margaret, they spun wool for their neighbors.  They received wool for pay, which they made into homespun material and socks, selling the same for a good price.

In spite of the long hours spent in earning a living, their life in this pioneer country was not all toil.  Many evenings were spent in merrymaking at the Church socials and in homes of neighbors.  They often gathered for quilting “bees”, wool carding “bees” and so forth.  On these occasions the menfolk would join them later in the evenings when the chores were done and they all enjoyed parched corn and apples or some simple refreshment which the hostess was able to furnish.

Margaret M. Foutz was a splendid neighbor, independent, and she strictly practiced the Mormon creed, “Mind your own business.”  She was well liked by her neighbors.  She and her family enjoyed the friendship and association of all in the little community.  Being a good neighbor and a good manager, Margaret found time to do for others as well as her own.  She was always ready to help and accommodate whenever she could.  She was an ideal Pioneer woman, honest, frugal, extremely neat, and made the best of every condition.  Her granddaughter, Mary Abigail White West, said of her:
				
			“She could live in a hovel
			And make of it a house of prayer
			With peace for all who entered there.”

In 1876, when Margaret was living alone in her log home, one of her neighbors, Annie Swenson, who later became the wife of Ezra F. Walker, wrote the story of her life as Margaret dictated it to her.  The following paragraph is taken from this story:  “I am now in my seventy-sixth year, the mother of twelve children, fifty-two grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren.  I have witnessed the growth of our American government under that inspired document, the Constitution of the United States, and have rejoiced under the wise administration of pure and good laws.   And I have also witnessed law set a defiance, and mobocratic violence run rampant, yea, verily, when the wicked rule the people mourn.”

Later, for some years this Pioneer mother lived with her daughter, Catherine.  Her daughter, Maranda, did her washing and ironing and often fixed dainty food for her, but the mother was independent and to the last, chose to do for herself all that she could do.  Old as she was, she was good natured and always looked on the bright side of everything.

On the morning of Aug. 5, 1896, Margaret arose as usual for breakfast.  She tiedied up her room and seemingly was in good health but before noon, she had passed away.  Only her daughter, Catherine, was with her at the time.

This mother of twelve children, at the time of her death – 95 years old, had 70 grandchildren, 126 great grandchildren, and 9 great great grandchildren.

(Excerpts about the Winter Quarters era from the book written by Delila Gardner Hughes)

Quote from Archibald Gardner, page 32, “We went back to Nauvoo.  On the way we encountered a small company of Strangites.  They extended their sympathy.  We did not argue with them but when they became impertinent, told them that if they did not leave we would have to cast out devils. Arriving in Nauvoo in good health and spirits, we found that the Twelve had started for the Rocky Mountains.  There were plenty of homes open to us.  We could have brick, frame, log, or stone houses without cost. The Saints had nearly all left who were able to go, and their homes were standing empty and unsold.  They had been driven out and what could not readily be disposed of was left behind. Some had furniture in-chairs, bedsteads, etc.  Here for three weeks we fitted up outfits and secured supplies which included flour, parched corn, corn meal and seeds for planting, then started west in companies of ten wagons to the company.  We crossed the Mississippi, passed Montrose and camped on the Bluffs a few miles north.  Here those who had horse teams sold or traded them for oxen and we proceeded westward.  Twelve miles through bad roads, and we camped.  The downpour that night brought water around the wagons up to our boot-tops and during the storm a son William was born to Jane, Brother Robert’s wife, May 22, 1846.  This was in Lee County, Iowa.  Next morning the mother and baby were made as comfortable as possible and the Canadian Company moved on.  We were endeavoring to catch up with the companies from Nauvoo who were ahead.  At Bonaparte we bought more flour.  We passed Pisgah and Garden Grove where farms had been planted and left for those who were not prepared to go on.  At Liberty Pole on Miskete Creek, where President Young and the main body of the Saints were camped a few miles from Sarpes Point, we rested.  While there the call was made by the United States Government for a company of five hundred men which was raised in a day or two but which left women and children on the prairie, some of whom were in poverty without shelter and sick.  Due to this call, our pilgrimage was delayed until the following year.  We crossed the river and camped at Cutler’s Park for about two months.  Here we cut the grass and put up hay preparatory to wintering our cattle.  Those we had no immediate use for, we drove in herds up the Missouri Bottoms into the rushes.  We then selected a place two miles from Cutler’s Park on the Missouri Bottoms and moved to it, naming it Winter Quarters, now Florence.”

From Jane Gardner Bradford’s diary: (a niece of Archibald Gardner) page 33

 “We left our home in Canada to gather with the Saints, on the last day of March, 1846.  The second day of our journey our horses ran away.  They smashed things up, nearly frightened us to death, but fortunately no one was injured.  It took a month to get to Nauvoo.   We crossed the Mississippi the first day of May and camped on the bluffs on the west bank.  There Brother John had the measles.  Remained here two or three weeks then traveled till we came to a town called Farmington on the Des Moines River.  Crossing, we camped near a town called Bonaparte.  Here I had the measles.  During the week we tarried, we finished buying our outfits.  The journey across the state of Iowa was slow and trying and made under great difficulties.  Remaining at Council Bluffs until after the Mormon Battalion were on their way to Mexico, we with many others crossed the Missouri River.  When father maneuvered his team and wagon onto the ferryboat, one yoke of wild steers jumped into the river with the yoke still holding them together and started back.  One steer swam faster than the other and they circled round and round, all the time getting nearer the middle of the stream.  Then father, without taking off his boots or clothing, plunged into the river after the animals, and grasp the tail of the fastest swimmer, held him back.  This headed them towards shore and so they were saved. 

 “We camped on quite a high hill for several weeks.  At this time I learned to knit from some of the girls in camp.  It was here dear sister Janet, aged fourteen months, died and was buried along with so many others.

 “Shortly after this we moved down on a kind of flat and spent the winter.   So the place got the name Winter Quarters.  That season was long and bleak and bitter.   We suffered from cold and hunger and most of us from sickness.  Some were very [ill], father worst of all.  He came nearly dying.  Mother found a doctor whose ministrations helped him and he recovered.”

Chapter 11, page 35   At Winter Quarters

 “My brother Robert, James Craig and I took a contract to get out mill timber which we did with the approbation of the Church Presidency.  Robert did the hewing of same with a beveled axe.”

(From Daily Journal of the Church)
 “Tuesday, September 29, 1846; President Young, Elder Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards were busy locating a bridge across Turkey Creek, at the head of Main street and at 2:00 p.m. let contracts for building a mill.

 “Archibald Gardner contracted to furnish the heavy timber at $4.75 per hundred, hewn.  William Felshaw bid off the froming at $1.70 ½ per square of ten feet and agreed to counter hew.”

 “The Church Presidency voted to remember us and if there were any good jobs to let after we reached the valleys, we were to be given preference.  President Young paid us in goods at St. Louis prices, and the balance in cash to the last cent.  He let us change a hundred dollar bill and take our pay out of it, leaving it in our hands three weeks.  When I went with it, Rockwood said we might keep it until called for.”

 “Winter had come when we commenced to build our houses.  We had hawled wood for the wives of those who had gone with the Mormon Battalion and helped them in various ways and so did not get into our own homes until about New Year’s.  It was a winter of much sickness.  I was the only one in our family who was not confined to bed.  I never enjoyed better health at any time in any country.  On October 10, 1846, Janet, my baby girl, aged eighteen months, died.  It was two years to the day since her brother Archibald has passed away of the same complaint—bowel trouble—and at the same age, excepting that she was one day older. About the same time Janet, daughter of my brother William, died and was buried there. (Note: There is no record of Archibald’s daughter’s burial at Cutler’s Park or Winter Quarters.  There is a record of William’s daughter only the spelling is Genet.  Her burial place is listed under Cutler’s Park and her birth date is in error.)  My wife was sick for about three weeks as was our son Robert.  Father and Roger Luckham were very ill with scurvy which was the general complaint thought to be due to the lack of vegetables in the diet and the fact that we lived on dry foods.  Brother William, his son John, and daughter Jane were sick in my house most of the winter. 

“There was so much sickness when little Janet died, that the care of the living left no time for mourning the dead and so our baby was laid away hurriedly and unceremoniously.  But when general health returned we grieved for the loss of our little one and have never ceased to mourn for her.”

“During our stay at Winter Quarters, my second son Neil, a boy of five and a half years, was run over by one of Bishop Hunter’s wagons loaded with eight large green cottonwood logs.  They were to be split with the maul, or mallet and wedge, into house logs.  The wagon was drawn by four [yoke] of stout cattle.  They had halted to rest and my two little boys were swinging on the chain under the wagon.  When the driver gave signal to start, Robert crawled out but Neil was caught between the wheels.  The hind one ran over his breast leaving him senseless on the ground.  We called upon Phineas Richards and he administered to him.  Then for three days and nights we kept him perspiring and his blood circulating by pouring water on hot bricks wrapped in cloths which were tucked around him so that he did not turn black.  Through our efforts and by the prayer of faith he was miraculously healed.”

“In the spring of 1847 I sold the good log house which we had lived in three months and had cost me about one hundred dollars, for a gun valued at ten dollars.”

From the history of Margaret Livingston, first wife of Archibald Gardner.. page 150

“When the Gospel was brought to Canada by John Borrowman, the Gardner brothers, together with their wives, mother, and sister accepted it.  Margaret and Janet were the only ones of the Livingston family ever to join the Church. 

They left Canada, twenty-four of them, in 1846.  They spent the winter in Winter Quarters where much sickness over took them.  Margaret was ill about three weeks, her son Robert about the same length of time, and then the baby Janet was stricken.  She died at the same age, and of the same complaint as her little brother Archie had succumbed to two years previously.  She lies buried at Winter Quarters.”

From the history of Abigail Sprague Bradford, second wife of Archibald Gardner.. page 155

“Persecution ran riot in Nauvoo.  When the remains of the murdered prophet and his brother lay in state, she and her daughter Mary Ann were among the thousands to view them. 
Abigail was very ill when her baby Tryphena was born September 30, 1845.  Her husband went for his brother’s wife to help at the sick bed.  He took his brother’s baby with him on the horse and was so long in returning that the family became concerned and went in search of him.  He was found feeling his way to the house.  He had taken suddenly and violently ill.  He died during the night.  A little eight year old son, Grandville, died about the same time.  Two vacant chairs met her gaze when Abigail was about to sit up.

Persecutions continued.  The Saints were being driven from their homes.  Abigail sold her two farms, two thousand bushels of corn, livestock and personal property for two outfits, including a plow, some other implement seeds for planting, and provisions.  

Her husband’s brothers, hearing of her intentions to go west, offered to care for her and her children and educate them, if they would abandon the idea of the perilous journey.  Bur her mind was settled; her heart was with the Saints.  

Abigail and children, father, and mother spent the winter of  ’46 at Winter Quarters.  Here her mother died and was buried.  Her brother Ithamer, his wife, and five children stopped at Mt. Pisgah with a company of Saints for the winter.  Sickness and death overtook them, and the wife and all the children lie buried there. 

In June, 1847, Abigail, with her father, her brother Ithamer, and her children, Mary Ann, Rawsel, Sylvester, Pleasant, and Tryphena, started for the west.  They traveled in Bishop Hunter’s company of one hundred wagons, Captain Horne’s fifty, and Captain Archibald Gardner’s company of ten.  During the journey one ox died, so they hooked up “Old Lil,” the milk cow, to take his place.  Each morning the milk was poured into the churn and each night a pat of butter was taken out.  The jolting of the wagon did the trick.  The “Old Sow”, a cannon used in the War of 1812, was brought across the plains with them to be used against the Indians if necessary.  Sylvester, Al Babcock, and Wiley Thomas took turns riding it.  The cannon is now in the museum on Temple Square.  Towards the end of the long trek one of her wagons became so good-for-nothing that she prayed night and morning that it would hold together until they reached their destination.  It broke down completely in Emigration Canyon, almost within sight of their goal.”

Copied and left on record at Winter Quarters by Carol Francis Lovele… [unreadable]  great granddaughter of Archibald Gardner and a missionary from July [unreadable] to July 1986.  Two great great grandsons, Bill and Lee Francis worked on the Creighton University when the cabin was built the spring of 1986.

The Story of Mary Field Garner
By Anne Garner Bafton",,,,,,1,,0,,0,0,NULL,0,,,NULL,0,0,"A brief history of the life of Mary Field Garner, born at Stanley Hill, Herefordshire, England, February 1, 1836, the daughter of William Field and Mary Harding Field, who had joined the church of the United Brethren, at Herefordshire, England.  When the first Mormon Missionaries came to Herefordshire to preach the Gospel they were very interested in their message and Elder Wilford Woodruff explained the Gospel to them.  My father and mother accepted the Gospel and were baptized into the Church in 1840.  They were very faithful Latter-day Saints and lived the Gospel’s teachings to the best of their ability.  They were glad to assist the missionaries and made them always feel welcome in their home.

After joining the church my parents were not content to stay in England, but they wanted to be with the main body of the church at Nauvoo. As soon as they could save enough money to make the voyage they came to America.  This was with some of the first companies of Mormon Emigrants to leave England.  The sea was very rough and there was a bad storm at sea which caused the ship to be driven off its course; thus it took us seven weeks to make the voyage.  We were only at sea a short time when I became sea-sick.  This sickness lasted the entire trip.  Father wanted me to see the ocean and I was too sick to walk so he carried me upon the deck to watch the ship going through the water.  We were all so happy to see land again and to know we were safe after such a terrible voyage.  After landing in America we soon came west to Nauvoo, Illinois, to join the saints there.  We found Nauvoo a beautiful city, which had been built up from swamp land situated near the Mississippi River.  This city had been built under the guiding hand of the Lord and the hard work of the Saints and their leaders.

My father did not have enough money to buy a home, so we rented a house from one of the Saints.  Here we lived in peace and happiness under the Prophet Joseph Smith.  Here he stood at the head of this dispensation, as Adam stands in the forefront of the human race.  We were very glad to attend church and listen to the Prophet Joseph and other leading brethren teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to us.  We marveled at Joseph’s superior intelligence of the Gospel and the simple way he could explain it unto the Saints, so that the most unlearned member could know and understand the truth.

The Saints, at this time, were enjoying peace and prosperity after the persecutions they had endured in Missouri.  They purchased more land and built comfortable new homes, thinking they had found a permanent dwelling place, free from their mob enemies.  Nauvoo was fast becoming famous and its population was increasing rapidly by the great emigration of Saints from England, but such peace and prosperity was not to last long, for our old enemies from Missouri, who had been aided by Governor Boggs, were not content to see us happy and prosperous, living our own way and worshiping God as we wished.  Hatred and jealousy again filled their hearts.  They wanted is [us] Mormons driven out of civilization, on to barren wastes where white man never dwelt before, to be killed by savage Indians, or eaten by wild animals and thus get rid of us forever.

They began to stir up ill feelings between the Saints and their new friends and neighbors in Illinois.  Our enemies did not posses [possess] a Christ like spirit, nor did they follow his teachings to “love thy neighbor as thyself”.  They made all sorts of false accusations against the Prophet Joseph and the other leading brethren of the church.  They demanded the arrest of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.  This they succeeded in doing, but our leaders proved their innocence and were released to return to their families.

Joseph was arrested many times on trumped up charges, but each time was roved not guilty.  He also had to hide for days at a time to escape the mob.  Members of the mob kidnapped some of the Saints and whipped them severely, and were cruel to them in different ways.  Then persecutions began to increase.  The saints were instructed to be on their guard all the time.

While at Nauvoo my father, William Field, and my two sisters, Eliza and Rachel died, leaving mother with six children to provide for.  We were very poor and had very little to eat.  Corn meal being our main food, when other food became exhausted we were put on rations of one pint of corn meal a day for the seven of us.  We could cook it as we wished.  OH! How hungry we were for something else to eat.  The children cried for a piece of white bread, and mother, oft-times, would cry with us, as she was unable to give us the bread or get enough food to satisfy the hungry cried [cries] of her children.  Mother worked hard to provide for us and keep our family together.  The Saints were very kind to us and tried to help us the best they could.  (You must remember most of the Saints were poor after being forced to leave their old homes and be driven from one state to another by anti-Mormons)  We did not complain.  We were too thankful to be at Nauvoo with the other Saints of God and to be acquainted with Prophet and leader, Joseph Smith, and listen to his teachings.

No greater words have ever been uttered by man, than the teaching of the prophet Joseph – “That man is an eternal being, as to his essence capable of eternal progression.  The intelligence of spirits is immortal.  It had not beginning; neither will it have an end.  There never was a time when there were not spirits, for they are co-eternal with our Father in Heaven”.  These to me, are very wonderful thoughts.  At another time he declared, “God himself was once as we are now and is an exalted man.  There and many other great things he taught us.  We loved to listen to his words as they fell from his divine lips, thus to be recorded in church history, to continue on and on to teach the correct principals of the Gospel to mankind, thus probing he was guided by the spirit of God to be able to know and understand these things and explain them to the people.

The Prophet was a very dignified looking man, and in his uniform of a General he was noble and kingly looking.  His voice was clear and distinct and he could take command of his men in a very intelligent way.  We were proud to call him or leader at all times.

I can remember the first American Indians I ever saw.  It was at Nauvoo, when Prophet Joseph invited them to attend meeting in the Mansion House he would explain the gospel to them.  While the Indians were in the meeting the children watched them through the picket fence.  I was one of those children.  We stooped down to keep from being seen.  The Indians were quite a curiosity with their quaint dress and manners.  Especially the squaws with their babies hung on their backs.

I shall never forget the morning Joseph and Hyrum crossed the Mississippi River and started west for the Rocky Mountains, because the mob demanded them taken to Carthage the mob would murder them to escape death they started for the west.  When some of their friends sent them word that they were fleeing from Nauvoo to leave the Saints to certain butchery Joseph said, “If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to myself.”  So they returned to Nauvoo.  The news spread rapidly of Joseph’s return.  We all hurried to greet him and welcome him back home, only to find he was giving himself up and going to Carthage, and had only stopped to see his family and talk with the leading brethren and to bid us all good-bye.  Joseph seemed to realize he would never see his family and friends again.  Joseph lingered to look at the beautiful city of Nauvoo and the temple.  He said, “This is the loveliest place on earth and the best people under the heavens.  Little do they know of the trials that await them.”  He afterwards said, “I am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer morning.  I have a conscience void of offense toward God and towards all men.  If they take my life I shall die an innocent man, and my blood shall cry from the ground for vengeance, and it shall be said of me, he was murdered in cold blood.”  We felt very sad to see them leave us, not knowing when they would return again to us.  How happy we were a few days later when we saw a group of men coming to Nauvoo.  Believing it [was] our beloved Prophet and Patriarch returning, the women and children joined hands and ran to meet them, glad to welcome them back home.  To our surprise it was Governor Ford and his men coming to Nauvoo.

We were ver [very] disappointed to learn Joseph and Hyrum were still in Carthage jail.  That afternoon Governor Ford and his men held a meeting in the Bowwery [Bowery] and Governor Ford delivered an address.  He warned the Saints if they caused any disturbance whatever, the whole country would come upon them to punish them. This statement the Mormon people resented, as they were not guilty of an offense toward any people.  They had kept the laws of the country.  We were glad to see Governor Ford and his company leave Nauvoo, because of the ill feelings they held toward the Saints.  While Governor Ford and his men were in Nauvoo the mob gathered at Carthage jail to take the life of our Prophet.  They were not content that he was persecuted and being held in prison on false charges.  They wanted to kill him.  Thus the mob, painted faces to disguise them, rushed up the stairway of the jail, and finding the door being held shut by the brethren inside, shot through the door.  The ball passed between the brethren.  As there was no usable lock on the door it was forced open by the mob and many shots were fired into the room, killing Hyrum and wounding John Taylor.  As Joseph was about to leap from the window someone on the outside of the jail shot him.  He fell to the ground a dead man.  After succeeding in killing the Prophet and Patriarch, the mob fled from the scene of their terrible, dishonorable crime.  Elder Richards told the Saints not to rush to Carthage, but to stay at home and be prepared for another attack from the mob.  There orders were obeyed.  We all tried to be as calm as possible, although we felt so badly over the terrible tragedy.

The bodies of Joseph and Hyrum were placed in rude lumber boxes and put in a wagon and each covered with brush to protect them from the hot sun.  I was with the Saints who met them outside the city and followed them to the Nauvoo Mansion House, where they were prepared for burial.

The Saints were grief stricken over the martyrdom, which had taken their beloved Prophet and Patriarch, who had guided them so faithfully through all persecutions a hours of darkness and despair, giving them hop [hope] and encouragement.

Mother took us children to view the bodies after they were prepared for burial.  At the public burial only bags of sand were deposited in the grave, the bodies being buried at night in Nauvoo Mansion House, afterwards being taken up and buried in the rear of the house where Joseph had lived.

Thus the Prophet and Patriarch sealed their testimony of the truthfulness of the Gospel (as did our Savior Jesus Christ) with their blood which shall forever remain a stain on the State of Illinois, with the broken faith of that state as pledged by the Governor, and is a witness to the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  They were innocent of any crime, but were murdered in cold blood to satisfy the evil desire of a blood thirsty mob.  No man could give more to prove his calling was divine and to uphold the principles e advocated were true and correct and were revealed to him by God, and he was not afraid to stand for that which he knew to be true.

After Joseph’s death there was some confusion as to who should be our leader.  Sidney Rigdon claimed to have had a vision that he should be our leader, but I, with my mother, was present at the meeting in the bowery when the mantel of Joseph fell upon Brigham Young while he was talking to the people.  Mother had the baby on her knee.  While the baby was playing with a tin cup he dropped it, attracting our attention to the floor.  Mother stooped over to pick it up.  We were startled by hearing the voice of Joseph.  Looking up quickly we saw the form of the Prophet Joseph standing before us.  Brother Brigham looked and talked so much like Joseph that for just a minute we thought it was Joseph.   There was no doubt in the hearts of the Saints from that moment on who was to be their inspired leader; who had been chosen by God to guide his people in the path of truth and righteousness, and who, later, was to guide them through many days of bitter trials and persecutions across the trackless desert.  Out beyond the borders of civilization, west to the Rocky Mountains to a very desolate land, and somewhere in that vast unknown to build a home where the Saints could dwell in peace away from the persecutions of their mob enemies.

After Brigham Young was sustained as our Prophet and leader the church was soon restored to order again under his guiding hand.  The saints were anxious to complete the Nauvoo Temple, as they had been commanded, through the Prophet Joseph Smith before his death and all the hard work and determination of the Saints the temple was completed and large numbers of the Saints received their endowments in the Nauvoo Temple.  

Before the Prophet’s death, he said, “It is thought by some that our enemies would be satisfied with my destruction, but I tell you that as soon as they have shed my blood, they will thirst for the blood of every man in whose heart dwells a single spark of the fullness of the Gospel.  The opposition of these men is moved by the spirit of the adversary of all righteousness.  It is not only to destroy  me, but every man and woman who dares believe the doctrines that God hath inspired me to teach to this generation.” His words were fulfilled.  The Prophet had only been dead a short time when our old enemies from Missouri, aided by Governor Boggs, began to stir up opposition against the Saints by accusing them of being thieves and counterfeiters and that they protected criminals who came among them.  These accusations were entirely false for the Mormon people had always respected the rights of others and upheld law and order.  In the fall of 1845 an anti-Mormon meeting was held at Morley.  This was a little settlement near Nauvoo, for the purpose of finding some excuse to rid the State of Illinois of all Mormons.  While this meeting was in session some of the mob fired on the building, not hurting anyone but causing plenty of excitement.  The meeting broke up in confusion and, as usual, the Saints were accused of the deed.  Of course this was not the truth, but it served the purpose for which Governor Boggs and Governor Ford and the mob intended it should.  Public sentiment became more bitter toward us.

Shortly afterwards a mob attacked the town of Morley, burning several houses and driving the people out to seek homes elsewhere.  Brigham Young knew this was the beginning of more trouble for us, and tat [taught] the mob, with Governor Ford and Boggs, world never be satisfied until the Saints were all driven out of Illinois.

The Twelve Apostles wrote a statement that since the public feeling were aroused against them and their people they would prepare to leave Illinois early in the spring, but they would like to be allowed to sell their property at a reasonable price.  This plan was accepted by the mob and they also promised to prevent any further attacks against the Mormons until they could leave.

The Saints kept their part of the agreement.  They were busy selling their property and making preparations to leave as soon as possible.  This displeased the mob for they knew if all the people did not sell they could drive them from their homes and take possession of their property.  The Sheriff of Hancock county was very friendly with the Saints and did all he could to protect us from the mob.  For his kindness toward us he was hated by the mob and they demanded his resignation.  We were all very anxious to leave our beautiful city of Nauvoo as our leaders could see the mob forces were getting restless and they feared another attack.  The move west was the desire of all the Saints. In February, 1846 the first company of Saints, with our leader Brigham Young, crossed the Mississippi River and started west for the Rocky Mountains and were soon lost from our view on the plains of Iowa.  We were sad to see them go and yet we were happy to know they would be free from mob attacks. From that time on the Saints continued to leave Nauvoo for the west to join the first company.  By the last of April most of the Saints had left Nauvoo.

The Saints who were left at Nauvoo were those who were too poor to provide means of conveyance and provisions to last for the journey across the plains.  Also the ones who were too sick and others too aged to travel and help blaze the trail west.  The brethren believed the mob would have too much mercy and respect for this helpless group of people to persecute them, but they were mistaken.  They began to mistreat us and kidnapped and beat some of the men, and did many other unkind deeds which are too numerous to mention here.

We knew this terrible treatment would continue until we were all out of Nauvoo, so the Saints agreed to leave within sixty days and appointed a committee to sell their property.  Again this did not satisfy the wicked mob, as they wanted possession of our property without cost to them, so they were determined to drive the Mormons from their homes.  You must remember the land which the Mormon people owned it, and in good faith with the government of the United States and the state of Illinois, for they intended to make this their permanent dwelling place.  They built good houses, tilled the soil, built a new city and a beautiful temple and obeyed the laws of their governments.  Now they were being driven out and robbed of their homes and all they had worked so hard for, and neither the state nor the Nation would lend a helping hand to save these same people from such a dastardly crime.  Never before or since has this great nation tolerated such great injustice to my any people, regardless of religion or color of the race.

In September, 1846 a mob of about two thousand came to Nauvoo, to the head of Mulholland Street, ready to march through Mulholland St. and take possession of Nauvoo by force.  The brethren tried to compromise with the mob, but their demands were too great, so the Saints and some of the new settlers decided to defend themselves.  They numbered only about four hundred and got guns and ammunition enough to them, but they expected some help from the state, as had been promised, but none came.  Major Clifford was in command of the Nauvoo forces.

My brother James Field fought in the battle.  For three days there were shots fired on both sides.  On the third day the mob made a desperate effort to get into Nauvoo through Mulholland Street and the Saints fought desperately to resist them.  Several of the mob were killed and wounded and a few of the Saints were killed.  The mob gathered up their dead and wounded and went back to their morning camp.  The Saints realized it was useless to fight the mob as we would soon be out of ammunition, then the mob would murder us and take possession of our homes.  Thus they compromised with the mob to let them march into the city and would surrender all our fire arms and the Saints would leave five brethren to sell their property and the rest of the Saints would leave Nauvoo as soon as possible.

In September the mob rushed into Nauvoo cursing and yelling.  They violated every promise they had made to the Saints.  Brockman, their leader, ordered every Mormon out of the city.  All so every man who had taken up arms against the mob in defense of their city.  The mob entered our sacred temple, using irreverent, profane language and horrid oaths.  A preacher, climbing the tower of the temple, shouted, “Peace to the inhabitants of the earth, now the Mormons are driven out.” The mob ran from place to place ransacking houses, taking whatever they wanted.  They were very cruel to the aged and the sick and abused the people who were burying their dead.  They held mock court in the temple.  Some of the Saints were tried and sentenced to death, while others were mockingly baptized in the river by the mobbers. The mob did not give us time to dispose o f our property, nor to pack our wagons with all the things we needed.  They demanded we leave immediately.  We hurried to pack some food, cooking utensils, clothing and bedding, which was afterwards unpacked b the mob and strewn over the ground by the mob as they searched for firearms.  While we were waiting to be ferried across the Mississippi River some of the mob, with drawn bayonets lined upon each side of the road leading to the river, while others searched the wagons and took all firearms the found, even to the housewives butcher knives, so we would have nothing to defend ourselves with.  My mother was successful in hiding three guns in her feather beds and the mob sis not find them.  A sympathetic member of the mob offered to carry mother’s baby down to the ferry, but mother refused the kindness.  Mother had some bread already in the kettles to bake.  Of course she did not have time to bake it, so she hung it on the reach of our wagon and cooked it after we crossed the Mississippi River.

After being ferried across the river on a flat boat we camped on the Iowa side of the river.  Here we were in another state and without any shelter from the scorching sun of the September days and the cold of the September nights.  Our food supply lasted only a few days.  We could look upon our beautiful Nauvoo being occupied by the savage mob, and the grain and other crops in the fields rotting, while we were going hungry.  One afternoon a heavy rain started.  Our bedding and clothing was soaking wet.  Some of the Saints were sick from exposure.  The sick and dying were made as comfortable as possible by erecting a makeshift shelter of old canvas, quilts, blankets, or anything we could spare to protect them from the storm.  Mother’s entire family kept well.  The food of the entire camp was gone so there was extreme suffering, and we were all so cold and hungry, but we were without homes, shelter or food and no friends to offer us assistance.  The Saints had been mobbed, persecuted, robbed, some murdered, and we who remained in Nauvoo had been driven from our homes to seek homes elsewhere.  The suffering and sadness of that camp I shall never forget.

“Here I must tell you of a little experience I had while crossing the plains.  As I have said the Indians gave us some trouble and especially me.  You see I had long red, curly hair hanging in ringlets down my back which seemed to attract the Indians.  I was afraid of them, but one Indian Chief took a fancy to me and wanted mother to give me to him as his white squaw and he would give her many ponies for me.  Of course mother refused him, but he was very determined to get me, so he followed our camp of Saints for several days.  We were all worried for fear he would steel me so after he left camp one night mother decided to try and hide me the next day.  In the morning before we broke camp mother took our feather beds and placed them over two boxes so I would not smother and I crawled in there.  Sure enough, he Indian Chief came back with his men.  He asked for me.  Mother told him I was lost.  He was not satisfied with this and so proceeded to look in every wagon to see if I was there, then he came to search ours.  He even felt of the feather bed I was under but did not find me.  He stayed with the company all day to see if I came back.  When it became dark that night he went away, saying sometime he would find me, but we never saw him again during the remainder of the trip to Salt Lake Valley…

After reaching the valley she later writes:
“Now by the time I was a grown up young lady and still had my red, curly hair, which still had it attractions for the Indians.  One day an Indian Chief came to our door, and to our great surprise it was the same Indian Chief whom we had our experience with on the plains.   He made us understand he had followed us here and still wanted me to be his bride.  Of course mother refused him again, but he would not go away.  He sat beside the door for three days.  This was an old Indian custom before demanding his bride.  After the three days were over again he asked me to be his white bride.  He offered mother many, many ponies, beads and blankets for me and said he would make me queen of his tribe that I would have a tent of my own and his other squaws could be my servants.”

She tells that her mother again said, “No” to his request.  “Still”, she writes he was not satisfied.  “I refused and told him I would never be with him…” and asked him to please go back to his Indian tribe and not bother me again.  With lowered head and bent shoulders, he went away sorrowing… I have never seen him since.”

18,histories,1165963869,,,,"Faith of Our Fathers, Dr. Ezekiel Lee",,,,,,1,,0,,0,0,NULL,0,,,NULL,0,0,"His name was Dr. Ezekiel Lee. The year was 1843 when a Mormon missionary came to Comstock, Kalamazoo, Michigan.  He spoke of the new religion and though Lee had been reared in a very religious family and was a leader in his church, he knew he had heard truth and he and his family were baptized 7 February, 1843 by E. Milo Webb.  George A. Smith and Wilford Woodruff were holding conferences in Comstock in Dr. Lee’s home when the Prophet Joseph Smith was martyred.  They were urging the people to go to Nauvoo and assist the Saints in building the Temple.

Dr. Lee and most of the members of his family arrived in Nauvoo in the summer of 1845, just in time to see that city at its best and its worst.  Beautiful homes, prosperous farms, a wonderful city “Nauvoo the Beautiful” but a city in torment.  The word had come.  The Saints must leave or give up this religion.  They prepared to move.  Ezekiel Lee in his heart must have said:  “Here I am Lord, I’ll go where you want me to go, I’ll do what you want me to do.”  And his wagon moved out into the darkness across the frozen Mississippi with nothing but their faith to keep them.

Winter Quarters—tragic Winter Quarters, the scene of 600 dead.  Yet the faith of the living transcended even death.  Dr. Lee was chosen to go with the first company under Brigham Young to the Rocky Mountains.  But—“Wait, you are a doctor, you are needed here.”  Faith to wait.  In 1848 he was chosen with three other men to bring the first mail to Utah from the people in Winter Quarters.  As they journeyed, they picked up a man on his way to California.  He was completely out of provisions.  They had barely enough for themselves but they did not question; they just added another burden willingly, in faith, to their already burdened shoulders.

In the late fall of 1849 they made the return trip to Kanesville, Iowa.  Ezekiel Lee found his family safe and well and in 1850 they returned to Great Salt Lake Valley—faith again their guide and protector.  He served as a bishop in Holladay Ward in 1851.  Grasshoppers had destroyed most of the crops and some of the Saints were living on sunflower seeds ground fine for flour.  At a meeting held in Big Cottonwood, Ezekiel reported that he had flour, considerable more than his portion and he wished to divide it.  He had already given 100 lbs. toward the deficiency.  He had faith to know that “as ye do it unto the least of these ye do it unto me.”

Ezekiel Lee was born November 8, 1795 in Chesterfield, Worcester County, Massachusetts, the son of Charles Lee and Rhoda Keith.  He passed away in Salt Lake City, Utah June 12, 1877.

From John Henry Latey to Elder J. Taylor

Elder J. Taylor, Dear Bro:

Knowing you, as well as the Saints generally, I feel a lively interest in the gathering of Israel, prompts me to write a few lines to let you know a little of the emigration at this point.  Bro. T. Woolley intended writing you, but I believe he has not done so, and as he has left here for Atchison to cross with Bishop A. O. Smoot’s train, I will endeavor to give you the information he intended.  The first, second, and third companies of independent emigrants, with their ox teams, left this camp with, in all, about 175 wagons, 1050 head of cattle, and 800 souls; they rolled out in right good spirits, rejoicing in their emancipation from gentile bondage, and with the flattering prospect of speedily testing the sweets of liberty in the bee-hive State of Deseret.  Good health has universally prevailed in our midst, and I am happy to be able to state that very few deaths have to be recorded.  We feel to acknowledge the hand of our God in preserving us from sickness and death.  Among the 800, above referred to, were two deaths, both Danish brethren; they died from disease contracted in the old county.  Elders Grant and Kimball, whom you appointed to purchase cattle for the emigration this season, have brought up several hundred head, and as far as I know or can learn have given general satisfaction in the discharge of their laborious duties.

The first and second companies of emigrants by hand carts, under the care of Caption Edmund Elsworth [Ellsworth] and David D. McArthur, assisted by Elders J. Oakley, William Butler, Truman Leonard, and S. W. [Spicer Wells] Crandall, piloted by Elder Joseph France, who acted as agent and Commissary, arrived in Camp on the 17th of July, in fine health and spirits, (singing, as they came along, Elder J. D. S. [John Daniel Thompson] McAllister’s noted hand cart song --- “Some must push and some must pull,” &c.)  One might not think that they had come from Iowa City, a long and rough journey of from 275 to 300 miles, except by their dust-stained garments and sunburned faces.  My heart gladdened as I write this, for methinks I see their merry countenances and buoyant step, and the strains of the hand cart song seems ringing in my ears like sweet music heard at eventide or in a dream.

The first company had among its number the Birmingham Band, and though but young performers, they played really very well --- far superior to anything to be found this far west.  In giving you this description of the feelings of the first companies, I give you in effect the feelings of the whole.  This is the bright side of the pictures, and is of those who may really be called Latter Day Saints; who have in continual remembrance the covenants they have made; who obey counsel, and may really be called Saints of the Most High God.  There are others --- for I have seen both sides of the picture --- who are apt to forget the God who has delivered them from their gentile chains and task masters, and are allured by fine promises and high wages; others there are whose faith is not of that nature to stand the trials they are called upon to undergo, and back out from five to fifty in a company of 300; but the mirth of the one kind does not interfere with the gloom of the other; or, vice versa, each one does what suits him best.  Those weak in the faith soon find those who will make them weaker; those who have backed out before them come up with their long faces, smooth words, and melancholy tone, prating away their words of comfort (?), and if they will only go away with them there is no end of the money and comfort they are going to have, and a team, ONLY NEXT SPRING, to ride in and go to the Valley.  I will say that these apostates, who give their time, and horses, and wagons, to pick up the wavering, are right zealous, and I thought if they were only as zealous in assisting the widow and the orphan, instead of those who are already cared for, they would be driving a good team; but it is all right, the sort that are led away from the line of their duty by such spurious promises and oily tongues --- well never mind that --- are not wanted in the Valley, and by staying here they save themselves two journeys --- one to Utah and one back.

I am prolonging my letter longer than I had any idea of, and will shorten it as much as possible by just giving you dates of arrival and departure of companies; and as I have before said the companies are much alike; they do not need separate descriptions.  The first hand cart company (Capt. Elsworth’s [Ellsworth’s]) left the ground on Thursday, July 16th; went out three and a half miles and camped; on the 20th I went out to settle up with Capt. Elsworth [Ellsworth], and saw them start off in good earnest to the tune of “Some must push,” &c., (can’t move without that.)

The second company (Capt.  D. [Daniel] D. McArthur’s) started on July 24th, being the anniversary of the entry of the Pioneers into the Valley, and was rendered more memorable to that company from their exodus from winter quarters.  The third company, under care of Capt. Edward Bunker, were nearly all Welshmen; they arrived on the 19th of July, and set out on their journey across the plains on the 30th.  The fourth company, , Capt J. [Jame] G. Willie, President, assisted by Elders [Millen] Atwood, [Levi] Savage, Abinansen, [William] Woodward, and [John] Chislett, moved on the ground on the 11th of August; part of the company moves out a mile or two to-day, and the remainder go on on Monday.  The companies stay here longer than they otherwise would in consequence of their carts being unfit for their journey across the plains; some requiring new axles, and the whole of them having to have a piece of iron screwed on to prevent the wheel from wearing away the wood.

Another company --- perhaps of hand carts --- have yet to arrive from Iowa City, in addition to wagon companies.  I will, if I have time and opportunity, give you an account of these companies.  I will now conclude by wishing you every good thing, and that you may be preserved in health and strength is the prayer of

Yours truly,
J. H. Latey

Church February 8, 1849 by Orville L. Cox, and was ordained into the 14th Quorum of Seventies under the hand of Henry Harriman and J. M. Grant and went through the House of the Lord and got his washing and anointing November 10, 1855. 

“I was born in Mosiah, Essex County, New York, April 26, 1829, and when I was eight years old, my father’s family, consisting of my parents, two brothers and two sisters and myself, moved to the state of Michigan and settled in Berthland, Berrier County, and lived and prospered in this worlds goods until the year 1843 when there was missionaries sent there from Nauvoo, belonging to the Latter-Day Saints.  My parents were very much opposed to them, and would not go to hear them preach.  

“I went and heard them and soon found their doctrine was scriptural, therefore, I was desirous that my parents should hear them.  So, I invited Richard Sprague and Phelps to go home with me and I introduced them as Mormon preachers.  They commenced conversation and before they left they convinced my parents of the truth of their doctrine.

“In a short time after my father, mother and sister, Lucy, were baptized.  Some time previous to this I was at a camp meeting, held by the Methodist Episcopal Church and was converted and baptized into their church by sprinkling.  I remained in their church about six months and saw that it was the same thing right over, all the time, and I got sick of it and went to the class leader and told him to scratch my name off the book.   He reasoned with me for some time but with no avail, so he scratched my name off, at last.  This time, getting taken in made me cautious afterwards.  When I heard the Mormon preachers I firmly believed it but intended to see if it would not flatten out and to see if they practiced what they preached.  But the more I heard of it the better I liked it.

“On the 28th of August, 1845, my brother, Joseph C. Fackrell, was married to Clarrysa Dempsey.  Previous to this time my brother, David B., left home and went to Wisconsin, so, I was the only boy that was left at home with my father.  About this time the sad news came that Joseph and Hyrum, the Prophet and Patriarch, were martyred and the Twelve had taken charge of he church and wanted the Saints scattered about, to gather to Nauvoo and prepare to go West.  My father accordingly sold his farm at a sacrifice of about one-half its value and started for Nauvoo, leaving my brother, Joseph and his wife, in Michigan, they not wishing to go with the Mormons.

“Nothing worthy of note occurred during our journey.  Only I saw great prejudices manifested against the Mormons.  The people would not keep us over night, if we told them we were going to Nauvoo, therefore, it caused us great trouble at times to procure lodging for the night.

“We arrived at Nauvoo the last of March, 1846.  We rented a house and moved into it and began to look around the city.  I expected to find the people perfect, but I could see men going through the city drunk, and could hear them swearing on all sides of me.  Thinks I, ‘Is this the people that calls themselves Saints?’  I thought they were nicknames, but when I come to consider that there were good and bad in all communities, I, therefore, commenced to look for good there and I could find the majority of them in that place.   We stayed in Nauvoo about three weeks and then started for the West.  We knew not where.

“While we were in Nauvoo my sister, Lucy, was taken sick from which she never recovered.  She was always delicate constitution and being exposed to the storms and cold was more than she could stand.

“Nothing worthy of note occurred until we arrived at Council Bluffs.   Here my sister, Lucy, died on the 20th of June, 1846, which was a severe blow to us all.  She was a good Saint and dearly beloved by all that knew her.   We laid her body in the ground, and her spirit returned to God who gave it, and there to rest for a little season, when it will again return and take the body in an immortal state, when Christ shall come to make up his jewels.

“Shortly after we arrived at Council Bluffs, Iowa, Kain [Thomas Kane] was sent there by the General Government to enlist five hundred men for the Mexican war.   I supposed it was a plot to see if the people were true to the government or not, but in the short time of a few days, the men were raised.  They raised all they could at the Bluffs and then Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball and others, went back on the road and raised the balance of them out of those that had not arrived yet.  The men started at a few days notice and left their families without houses or homes or anything to subsist upon, and fight the battles of their enemies and those that had driven them repeatedly from their homes and houses.  After they had gone, the balance of us, that was left, set about preparing for the winter.   We built log cabins to live in and cut hay for the cattle and then went down into Missouri to get provisions.  I went down to Missouri once that fall with a team and took a job of work to make provisions to last through the winter and returned home.

“I stayed until the beginning of the winter and went down again without a team.   I was gone some time but only got a half a months work and returned home that spring which was 1847.

“The Twelve with some others started as Pioneers to find a location for the Saints.  That spring I stayed at home and put in a small crop and left my father at home to tend it.  I took a team and went to Missouri, this time my sister Betsy Jane, went with me.   This time I went as far as Savannah, here I got work and Betsy got a job of spinning.  Also, by so doing she could be making something.  We stayed about six weeks and returned home loaded.  When we got home I set about cutting hay for the winter.   I cut about 15 tons and stacked up on the prairie and hauled a few loads home.  Early in the fall the prairie got on fire and burned up one stack of about eight tons and in trying to backfire around the other, that got on fire and burned up too.  So it left us with very little hay.

“Late in the fall of 1847 the Twelve and part of the men that went with them returned bringing news that they had found a valley in the Rocky Mountains that they had named Great Salt Lake Valley, it having a great lake, Salt Lake, in it that was of considerable size.  They left a few men to guard the place until the company that followed them should arrive.  When they got back they gave out word that they wanted all that could, to prepare to go with them the next spring.  Being scarce of hay that fall I took three yoke of oxen and went to Missouri, partly to keep the cattle and to make a fitout to go in the spring, and went and  took a job of hauling logs to a sawmill.  I was where I could buy corn for ten cents per bushel, so I could keep my cattle fat all winter, so in the spring they were in good shape to start.  I was successful in making a fitout while I was there this time.

“There was quite a number of soldiers returned that went at the call to California, and among them was one, George W. Hancock, who commenced paying his attentions to my sister, Betsy.  When I returned I made every preparation for starting to the Valley on the 14th of May 1848.   George W. Hancock and my sister, Betsy Jane, were married and the next day, the 15th, we left her and started for the Valley.  Nothing of note occurred with us until we arrived in the Valley October 1848.  When we arrived we found a barren looking place but we had been on the road so long that we were glad to stop.  We set about preparing for the coming winter.  I went about ten miles north of Salt Lake City and found a good place and moved up there and as soon as we got camped, I was taken sick with mountain fever, and lay sick about two months.  In about two days after I was taken sick, we moved to the place I had looked at.  As soon as I got about we set about building a house to shelter us from the storms, but to do our best it was about the middle of January, 1849 before we got into it.  In the spring we commenced to open a farm by fencing and putting in grain but the crickets and cattle took all we could raise, that year being 1849, but the next year we raised a plenty to keep us.  The fall of 1849 G. W. Hancock and family arrived in the valley.  This year the emigration commenced to go through here to California, and sold clothing here cheaper than it could be bought in the states; which fulfilled a prophecy of H. C. Kimball in the fall of 1848.  He said, ‘Within a year clothing could be bought here cheaper that in the states.’  It was a great help to the people in these valleys for clothing was getting scarce.  January 13, 1850 I married Martha Ann Chapman and left my father and went to work for myself.

“I started in the world with nothing but my hands to help myself with.  I worked for my bread and rented some land and put in some wheat and I was prospered in all things that I went at.  This summer being 1850 my oldest brother, David B. Fackrell, came into the valley on his way to California.  He stopped and thought he would stay a few days and visited us, as we had not seen him for about the space of twelve years.”

From the history of James, Jr.’s parents, we find the following notation:
“When the parents grew feeble, James Jr. built them an adobe house near the meeting house so that they could attend Church more easily (This home was located on what is now 8th West and the southwest corner of 4th North).  They gave the land to the south of the home for the building of the West Bountiful Chapel.

“James Jr. took his father and mother to his home and cared for them until the death of his father December 21, 1867.  His mother lived 18 more years spending the balance of this time back in her own home on 8th west and 4th north.  She died September 8, 1885.

James Jr. spent his time in doing service to his parents and building up the community.  After his death he was buried in the Bountiful City Cemetery where his parents are also buried.  He died May 16, 1892.”

The following is a compilation of excerpts from two letters, the first, written February 20, 1881, was placed in the cornerstone box in a old Relief Society Building in Provo, Utah in 1931, after it was opened and read, it was kept on display in the Relief Society in Salt Lake City, Utah. The other letter was written January 12, 1885, as a “sketch of my life, so they can trace our family after I am gone.”

“I, Martha P. Thomas to my children or descendants to whom this may come in the year 1931….I write the following items  hoping they may be of some use or interest to my descendants, fifty years from this date.

I was born February 20, 1808, in Sumner County, Tennessee.  I am seventy three years of age this day, in good health and spirits and looking for and hoping for the coming of our Lord and the redemption and establishment of Zion upon the earth.

My father, Isaac Jones, enlisted to fight for our county in 1812, and died in General [Andrew] Jackson’s army at New Orleans. My mother’s maiden name was Polly Oglesby. [She was] the daughter of Daniel Oglesby and Eliza Hollis.  Isaac Pierce married my mother three years after the death of my father. She died the next year leaving me and my three little brothers alone. I was partially raised by my uncle William Jones and his wife Polly Haw.

My husband, Daniel Stillwell Thomas was born March 15, 1803, in Sumner County, Tennessee, Grandfather [Henry Thomas] was a Revolutionary War soldier [enlisting in 1777 and serving for three years]. His mother’s name was Rachel Stillwell. I was married to my husband February 3, 1826 near Galatin, Sumner County, Tennessee, in my eighteenth year. I lived with my husband fifty-two years and have been a widow three years. [Of] my eleven children, four are dead; one lost to our knowledge at present and six alive, married and at present reside in Lehi. I now have seventy grandchildren and thirty-one great grandchildren.

In 1827 [my husband and I] moved to Callaway County, Kentucky. We joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints there in 1835. We were part of the labors of Wilford Woodruff when he was on his first mission. We gathered with the body of the Church in Missouri in 1837. We bade farewell to all kindred, which was a sad affair, especially to father and mother Thomas. They belonged the Church, but were too old to stand the journey. Brother Woodruff blessed them and said that they would yet stand in Zion. So they did, for we sent for them and in the fall they came by water. They soon died and were buried side by side on Long Creek, Missouri.  He was 84 years old and mother 78.

Our leader up to Missouri was Henry G. Sherwood. The Saints then resided in Far West, Caldwell County. We stayed there about two years, being all the time persecuted by the mobs on account of our religion. We had entered and paid for a large farm, had built a house on it, surrounded ourselves with all necessary improvements to a home and were getting well fixed in life when in 1839, the mobs came upon us in force and drove us away from our home. Our house was the last on the Richmond road, leading from Far West to Richmond. About two miles from our house there was a little place called Buncom, where the mob gathered to counsel which way to go. At first they did not seem to notice those living close by, but would go to David and other far away places.  Therefore, my husband and others were called to go and guard those settlements, which left me alone with my little ones.

I cannot tell how long I stayed alone; I was busy gathering our crops….but when they (the mob) passed by, if they wanted anything they would help themselves. Later I made up my mind, if Mr. Thomas got home alive, I would never stay another night alone.

He came home Monday, about nine o’clock, [and] Tuesday, about six in the afternoon, word was sent [that] the mob was gathering for a battle [between our] house and Crooked River. He commenced buckling his sword. I [told] Morgan to yoke up the oxen. He [Daniel] looked with surprise, “What are you going to do with the oxen?”

“I’m going to town.”

“What! Tonight?”

“Yes, I will not stay another night, alone!”

He saw I was in earnest –laid down his sword and began to throw things I the wagon, pell-mell.  I had a big iron kettle of beef bones boiling. He drained the water off and hoisted it in the front of the wagon, then picking up the children, tossed them in. I called to him, saying,” Don’t set them in the kettle of bones!” We had to stop and laugh, even though all our enemies were upon us. He then gathered up his gun and sword and started on the run as his men had gone on ahead. The children and I started for Far West just as the sun was setting.

What took place in the next few days many have told; the Battle of Crooked River…. In a few days the militia; 4,000 in number, marched in and camped on the east bank of Goose Creek. How horrifying it was to us to hear the yells, shouts and screams; the damned in hell could not be any worse than that was. That evening Brother Joseph and his brethren walked into camp ‘like lambs to the slaughter’. I will never forget those days in time and eternity. I wish I could speak so it would be stamped on the mainds of my posterity as with the [in]delible ink, never to be ruled out.

The leaders of the Church were imprisoned, my husband with them. [At their release], we were told to go home and get ready to leave the state in so many days or we would be shot – unless we denounced our Prophet and leader. This we could not do. We had to leave in a great hurry, on account of the mob and to save our lives. Many of our friends, the saints, being killed.

With the loss of all we had, save five children, a small yoke of cattle, one old wagon, the clothes we wore and one pair of shoes, all we had for our four children. These were worn by our eldest, Morgan. The snow was about six inches deep. We went by way of Quincy into Illinois. (Note: The Saints crossed the Mississippi River at Quincy.)

[With] the ice leaving the river now….the boats will make one trip today. It falls to our lot to cross. Having no wagon (the Thomas’ sent their wagon and team back to Far West for those left behind) we could not put our goods all in the same boat. The boatmen said they would make another trip that evening. We made our landing good at Quincy.  Just imagine, I was left on the shore, with no living one with me, but four small children. The sun was down. I could not see across the river. I wrapped the children in bed clothes…and sat down on the bed to watch for the boat. I began to look at my situation, not knowing what moment I might be taken sick (give birth). For the first time the tears stole down my face on my own account. One of the little ones said, “Mother, are you sick?” “No,” said I, “the wind is so cold.” Just then, Brother Wiswanger rode up and saw I was feeling bad and stayed with me until he heard the boat come. He had twelve miles to ride after dark. They soon landed and we were all together again. [Mr. Thomas] got a man with a cart and mule to haul the children and bedding to camp Milwaukee. In a few days I was put to bed quite comfortable, a fine son in my arms.  Joseph Alma, named…for our Prophet Joseph, then in chains in prison, was born in the wood on March 17, [1839].

Brother Joseph escaped from prison, went up the river, [and] bought a town site called commerce, afterward, Nauvoo. Here he called the Saints together. In the spring of 1840, we moved to Nauvoo, found our dear friend and leader, Henry G. Sherwood was the surveyor.  He had a good lot in reserve for us. There was very near enough timber on it to build a house and fence it. [We remained] there with the Church until the final expulsion of the Saints in 1846.

During our [six year] stay in Nauvoo, we built us another home which we could not sell on leaving. The Saints, during their stay there, built up a large and fine city and a beautiful and valuable temple, my husband and oldest son working on them and the other public buildings most the time.

To my posterity I will say, we esteemed it a privilege to work on the House of God and te Nauvoo House. We were then called to the house to receive the blessings the Lord has in store for the faithful, which amply paid them for all their labors.

After our expulsion from Nauvoo [in 1846], we started for the mountains without purse or script, wagon or team. We had our two selves, eight children, one cow, nine sheep and two pigs. We stayed in Bounapart, Iowa, and Winter Quarters over two years. In 1847, we buried Morgan Melican, or oldest son, in Florence. (Note: Morgan M. Thomas acquired stone cutter’s comsumption while working on the Temple at Nauvoo.)

My readers, the clouds of sorrow never gather so black but what there is a bright star to be seen by those that trust in the Lord. Joseph Young came to Morgan the evening before he died. He laid his hands on his head and said, “Morgan, be calm as a summer morn, be quiet, all is well with you. It matter not whether you live or die, for there is no power in heaven, earth or hell that will cheat you out of a martyr’s crown.” At nine the next morning he breathed his last, without a struggle, or moan, as though he was going to sleep.

In the spring of 1847, the pioneers started to find the vallies [valleys] of the mountains. Soon after the first company of Saints started with Brothers John Taylor and Parley P. Pratt, their leaders. Teamsters were very scarce; you will remember 500 of our best men were called to go and fight for the government (The Mormon Battalion).  Brother Van Cott…spoke to me…about Isaac, our [thirteen year old] son, going with him to drive the team. He said the teams would be coming back and he would send a wagon and team for us to come to the vallies [valleys] the next season. By this time, Abigail Abbot had made it up for Matilda, our oldest daughter to go with them. Brother and Sister Abbot were going with Brother Van Cott as chief cook and manager. I was satisfied that if she (Matilda) stayed on the Missouri bottoms that summer she would be buried with her brother. She was in the last stage of chills and fever. My heart almost sunk in despair, whether I could let her go and live, or keep her and let her die. [Brother Van Cott] said, “I will take both of them as my own children, also I will live up to my word concerning the wagon and team.” [This] opened up the way for us to go to the vallies [valleys] of the mountains. One night after going to bed with my little ones, I was tracing our travels up the present, then stretching out as far west as I could, I saw a vision of my mind, that if Mr. Thomas did not go with President Young as teamster, we would not get the wagon and team that Isaac was bring, as it would be turned back to help the company into the vallies [valleys]. (Note: At Martha’s urging, Daniel offered his services as teamster to President Brigham Young. He left his wife and family to drive the wagon which held the records of the church.  Martha stayed at Winter Quarters, borrowed a loom and began weaving as a means to support her family, until her husband and son returned)

[When] Mr. Thomas and Isaac [returned they] went to the Mission House, where the Governor kept a large school for the benefit of the Omaha Indian tribe, and worked about six weeks, for the provisions we were obliged to have before they would allow us to start across the plains. We the 15th of June, 1849, left our log cabin to cross the [Missouri] river, the water was so high it was almost impossible to get to the ferry. On the 5th of July, we started for the vallies [valleys] of the mountains, where the Prophet said we should go. We had a prosperous journey, no accident, except several stampedes in Brother Perkin’s company of fifty…arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, October 14, 1849.

My dear readers, do not think we landed in Salt Lake Valley on ‘flowery beds of ease.’ We did not, neither did we expect to. The Lord never promised salvation on any such plane. It is through much tribulation that we enter the kingdom of God, therefore we were not disappointed. [When we] landed in the vallies [valleys], who could not acknowledge the hand of God in our deliverance?


We had come to a new country, far removed from all sources of supplies and containing nothing deemed necessary to sustain civilized life.

My husband labored mostly on the public works in Salt Lake City. I was there set apart by Bishop Petegrew to take change of the fast meetings in the 10th Ward during the summer season. We remained in Salt Lake City about four years, until our son-in-law, Israel Evans [married to Matilda Ann] was called on a mission to England, when we moved to Lehi, Utah County, and took charge of his farm and family during his mission.

We lived in Lehi until the present time, taking our part in all the labors incident to settling a new country, and have lived to see the land to which we came and that contained nothing sustain civilized life, become famous for its fruits, grain and vegetables. Also it’s minerals and as well supplied with all deemed necessary as most other lands are.

In Lehi, the Relief Society was reorganized with Sister Coleman Evans as President, and myself as first counselor. The Society was again in 1879 when T. R. Cutler was appointed succeeded Bishop David Evans.  Sister Rebecca Standing was appointed President of the Society and myself continued as counselor.

June 27, 1879, D. S. Thomas, your father was buried. This leaved me standing in the midst of the Saints surrounded with a numerous posterity, which is a great comfort to me. At times the clouds of sorrow will hover over me. Then I call on my Father for help and  He is sure to comfort me.

Our family names are as follows:

Morgan, born Dec. 7, 1826, Sumner Co., Tennessee – died at Winter Quarters.

Matilda Ann, born Feb 5, 1830, Callaway Co., Kentucky – married Israel Evans.

Malinda S., born Feb 9, 1832, Callaway Co., Kentucky – married Alex H. Loveridge – died in Lehi, 1871.

Isaac, born May 30, 1833, Callaway Co., Kentucky – we do not know his whereabouts at present.

Emma Smith, born Oct. 21, 1836, Callaway Co., Kentucky – married John Woodhouse.

Joseph Alma, born Mar. 17, 1839, in the woods in Adams, Co., Illinois – married Mary Ellen Lawrence.

Daniel Wright, born Dec 11, 1842 Nauvoo, Hancock Co., Illinois – married Mary Ann Ashton.

Mary Ann, born Jan. 1, 1845, Nauvoo, Hancock Co., Illinois – died at birth.

Martha Jane, born Jan. 1, 1845, Nauvoo, Hancock Co., Illinois – married Newel A. Brown.

Sarah Phlinda, born Feb. 3, 1849, Honey Creek, Iowa on our journey westward from Nauvoo – married Arthur Stewart.

John Jones – born Jan. 10, 1852, Salt Lake City, Utah – married Myra Clark.

I leave this short account, together with  my blessing and my testimony to the truth of the work of God, in the which I have passed most of my life, and on account of which I have had to sacrifice the homes I have named and to pass through the trials consequent on such drivings and journeyings. To my descendants, together with my prayers that all of my descendants may prove faithful to the cause for which we have contended, [that they] may realize all the blessings contemplated by the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth. I am thankful to the God of Heaven and the Heavenly Host that has ever guarded us through life. May the same blessings ever be upon our posterity is the wish of your mother. Amen.”

22,histories,1189030945,,,,"History of Richard Spencer",,,,"Richard Spencer File - Pioneer Research Library Mormon Trail Center at Historic Winter Quarters",,1,,0,,0,0,NULL,0,,,NULL,0,0,"On the 5th of October, 1794, a son was born to William and Hannah Spencer at Easington, Yorkshire, England.  He was proceeded by a brother John 5, William 2, and a sister, Jane 3.  The new child was called Richard, and little did the family know then that his destiny would take him across the waters to a new land.

Nothing more is known of his childhood, except that a brother, George followed him in sequence in the family.  All were christened at Slaidburn Parish.  George died at the age of 12 years and was buried at the Slaidburn churchyard, 26 October 1808.

Richard was a farmer and at the age of 25, he married Mary Earnshaw, a daughter of Thomas Earnshaw and Elizabeth Taylor, also of Easington, in 1819.  Mary was twenty years old at the time.

On the 20th of February 1820, their first child, a son called George, was christened at Slaidburn Parish.  They must have had to move a lot to find employment, as the next two children, both girls were born at Burton in Kandel, Lancashire, where their father worked as a clogger.  The oldest was named Elizabeth, which was later shortened to Betney.  Her birthdate was listed as the 6th of Ocotber 1821, and the christening was the 4th of November 1821.  Hannah, the youngest, was born the 18th of September 1823 and christened the 2nd of November 1823.  These girls were named after their grandmothers, Elizabeth for the maternal grandmother, and Hannah for the mother of Richard.

Ann, the next in line, made her debut at Slaidburn on the 2nd of October 1826.  Jane and Martha followed at Tesside for christening 22 February 1828 and 29 September 1829 respectively.  Then on 21 March 1832, came William, whom they named for Richard's father.  Richard Jr. was christened 20 April 1834.  John was christened on the 11th of October 1835; and Mathew on 29 October 1837--all at Waddington Parish in Yorkshire.

On the 22 Decenber 1838, Mary Spencer, the mother of this large family, was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, by  a missionary sent out in the early days of the church, named Joseph Fielding.  This event was to change the lives of the family.  Converts were persecuted in those days, as the family moved to Clitheres in Lancashire, where Rachel, the eleventh child was born the 23rd of December 1839.  A year later, an epidemic claimed the lives of William and Mathew,  on the 23rd day of May 1840 and the 24th of October 1840 respectively.  They were buried side by side in the churchyard at Clitheres.  George, who was apprenticed to a couple of old bachelors at Dalehead, presented much concern and sadness for the family when they decided to immigrate to America.  Richard, the father, walked forty miles to persuade his son to leave with them, but to his dismay, the bachelors talked him into remaining with them.  In return, he was to inherit their property at the event of their deaths.  This must have been a difficult decision for the family to make, not expecting to see George again.

Sunday the 7th of February 1841, they boarded the ship, Sheffield, at Liverpool and sailed for America.  255 Saints under the leadership of Hiram Clark were aboard as steerage passengers.  The ship Sheffield, of which R. King Porter was Master, arrived in the Port of New Orleans in the state of Louisianna on the 13th day of March 1841.

Richard was listed on the ship's log as 45 years, Mary 40, Betney 18, Hannah 15, Ann 13, Jane 11, Martha 9, Richard Jr. 6, John 4, and Rachel as an infant.

They no doubt took a boat up the Mississippi River as far as Illinois.  It was here that Elizabeth  married George Muck, a native of Pennsylvania, 25 October 1843.  Soon after the birth of their first child, she died.  Her husband then married Jane at Oquawka, Illinois on the 25th of October 1846.  The twelfth child of Richard and Mary , a son they named Jacob Hyrum was born on the 5th of November 1845 at Hancock County, Illinois.

From here they traveled to the Hunstfield Branch at Pottawattami County, Iowa, where they made temporary homes at Kanesville.  They followed the trek westward and had reached Council Bluffs, when Richard, the father, was thrown from his horse and killed, 22 August 1851.  Many hardships were endured, but Mary (as a widow) came across the plains with her seven remaining children in 1852.  They came with the third company, under the leadership of Capt. Thomas G.D. Howell.  They settled in Payson, Utah County, Utah.

Jane and Martha went on to California, but Ann, Rachel, John, Richard Jr, and Jacob Hyrum married here and stayed in the vicinity of Payson until their deaths.  Mary died at the home of Jacob Hyrum in about 1889 at the ripe old age of 90 years.  She was buried in Payson.
