He was apparently one of the first settlers of the Appanoose area in around 1836. There he built a house with an orchard, some shade trees, and a barn at the location called the "Big Mound." He was a postmaster in 1839. He was a storekeeper in Nauvoo and kept his own account book. He was a 1st Lieutenant in the Nauvoo Legion as of 4 February 1841. In January 1846, Elvira and Amos filed for a divorce, but it appears that it was never made final. He is connected with a mob lynching of some harvesters in the Nauvoo area on 4 July 1846. He was in Nauvoo during the Battle of Nauvoo and was friendly (he didn't fight against the Mormons), but he ran away from the fight. In 1850 Amos was residing in Hancock County, Illinois. By 1870 he was a farmer with $48,000.00 in real wealth and $6,000.00 in personal wealth.<br /><br />Sources: Ancestral File; International Genealogical Index; Merchants and Grocers Licenses Fees, pp. 1, 3, 4; Hancock County Circuit Court File, p. 147; Hancock County Tax Register, 1850; Alexander Neibar Journal; Amos Davis Account Book, p. 3 (28 December 1838); Amos Davis Account Book, p. 32; Amos Davis Account Book, p. 29 (23 May 1838); Amos Davis Account Book, p. 92 (11 November 1839); Temple Committee Ledger, Book D, p. 375; Rowena Miller Files, Lands and Records Office, Nauvoo Restoration, Inc.|
